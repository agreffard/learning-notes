## The “difficult conversation”

- Difficult conversations during difficult times is all about **balancing empowerment and direction**.
- Imagine that there are levers to pull in every conversation:
    - an **empathy** lever
    - a **candidness** lever
    - a **quietness** lever
    - a **bottom-line** lever
- Your job is to figure out what tools will be effective in each conversation.

### Avoid getting stuck by finding your ‘why’.

- Make sure that you don’t get stuck, too. 
- Find a north star for the conversation. Find your “why”.

### “Stop” isn’t useful without a “start.”

- But “stop” doing something isn’t really helpful, unless there’s a “start” doing identified.
- “Stop” shuts the conversation down, and usually [amygdala hijacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdala_hijack) the other person.
- Bring it back to the why

### Bottom-line it.

- Bottom-lining is a really important skill in giving strong direction.
- If you ramble because you’re nervous, or you want to thoroughly explain, your point won’t be clear.
- Whenever you need to give some strong direction, get the whole thing down to just **one or two sentences, max**.

## Wait, don’t say that yet!

- Often, a person will push back when you give strong direction, because **they don’t feel like their concerns are being heard**. 
- You’re trying to switch things up, but their hesitation or disagreement hasn’t been addressed yet.

### Acknowledge concerns.

- Start by acknowledging the person's concerns, honestly and authentically!

### Stay forward-facing.

- Turn the conversation to focus on the future.
- Don't waste more time litigating what’s happened in the past.
-  Your one-on-one is a great time to process this and make decisions together.

## This will feel uncomfortable.

- The prep for these conversations can typically feel more intense than the actual conversations.
- If you’re not sure what someone’s primary worry is, [ask questions](https://larahogan.me/blog/questions-for-biceps-core-needs/).
    - Reflect back what you hear (“_It sounds like [...], do I have that right?_”)
    - Again, imagine that there are levers to pull in every conversation: a **curiosity** lever, a **bluntness** lever, a **humor** lever, etc.
        - Each conversation will be different, and will require different tools.
        - Keep trying different tools as you gather more data about what’s working and what isn’t.
