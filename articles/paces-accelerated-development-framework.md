___


- By 2030, data centers' power demand will **grow by 160%**.
- To stay competitive and ensure a **carbon-free future**, renewable energy projects must move **at the speed and cost of fossil fuel development**.
- The traditional development workflows are broken, making projects vulnerable to **losing time and money**.

# The Cost of the Old Development Workflow

-  Generation projects can take up to **4 years** to reach deployment.
- The current approach follows a **sequential workflow**, with each phase hiding **potential project-killing risks**
- These risks, surface **months or years into development** and derail projects after significant investments have been made.

# What is ADF (Accelerated Development Framework)?

- The Accelerated Development Framework (ADF) is a **transformative approach** designed to eliminate inefficiencies and redefine how renewable energy projects reach site control.
- It reshapes the renewable energy development framework by **de-risking projects from Day 1**.
- It modernizes the development process and helps developers:
    - cut timelines
    - lower costs
    - expand market reach
