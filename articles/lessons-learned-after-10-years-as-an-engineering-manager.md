# Things I’ve learned in my 10 years as an engineering manager

Non-obvious advice that I wish I learned sooner.

_____

### 1. The “well-defined engineering manager role” is a myth

- There is **no standard definition** for an Engineering Manager.
- The role is **defined by the team's needs**.
- It requires you to balance across four pillars: **Product**, **Process**, **People**, and **Programming**.
- The key is to identify **where your team’s bottleneck lies** in your software development lifecycle. 

### 2. Everyone needs to care about the Product

- Code is valuable only when it benefits the end user.
- Teams that **understand the problem**, not just the spec, **can pivot when necessary**.

### 3. There is no such thing as a free lunch when it comes to processes
- Every process trades time and attention for reliability or quality.
    - The problem occurs when teams stop questioning if the trade is still worth it.
- The process is not the thing. It's always worth asking, do we own the process or does the process own us?
- The right process varies based on context: team size, experience levels, and deadline pressure.
- Keep questioning and iterating.
- If a process isn’t improving delivery, cut it.

### 4. Communicating downward requires transparency
- Your direct reports look to you for **leadership and clarity**, and trust that you’ll **tell them what they need to know**.
- A good manager is like a **transparent umbrella**:
    - They protect the team from unnecessary stress and pressure
    - but **don’t hide reality** from them.
- When you do deliver hard news, **state it clearly** and focus on how the team will do about it.
    - If you act scared, they’ll be scared too.
    - Your goal is to get them thinking about the next steps.

### 5. Communicating up requires a strategy

- Executives can’t think of every possibility in detail - **that responsibility lies with you**.
- People above you have **limited time to focus** on your specific issues.
    - If they take a misguided action based on what you tell them, it will be your fault.
- If you believe in something, **clearly state your case**, including the advantages and disadvantages.
- Guideline: context → problem → plan / alternatives → what support you need.

### 6. You are 10% player, 30% coach, and 60% cheerleader

- **Player** (10%):
    - You might take on work your team isn’t excited about, but that matters: CI/CD improvements, flaky tests, process tooling.
    - However, you need to **stay off the critical path**. 
- **Coach** (30%):
    - Your performance as a manager is **the sum of your team’s output**.
    - Coaching involves preventing problematic behaviors from becoming normalized, such as **toxicity**, **repeated mistakes**, and **consistent underperformance**.
    - It also means supporting engineers' growth by:   
        - **challenging** them appropriately
        - providing the right **feedback**
        - helping them **develop skills** they’ll carry forward.
- **Cheerleader** (60%):
    - **Praise people** more than you think you should.
    - Praise **genuinely**, not automatically
        - when praise becomes expected, it loses its impact.
    - Make your engineers’ wins **visible** beyond your team.

### 7. Your goal is for your team to thrive without you

- If you can’t take a month off and return to a well-functioning team, you need to work toward making that possible.
- You’re too busy to be the bottleneck.
- **Train others** so work continues smoothly even when you’re overwhelmed or unavailable.
- Avoid making people feel they need your permission for small, reversible decisions. **Empower them** with agency.
    - **Request to stay informed** about their decisions
    - but let **them handle the technical side**.

### 8. You can’t succeed without trusting your team

- Micromanagers micromanage because they don’t trust.
- You need to trust both your engineers' **abilities** and **honesty**:
    - If you can’t trust their skills at their level of experience, **it’s your job to help them get better**.
    - If you can’t trust their honesty, and you have good reasons not to, then **you need to part ways**.

### 9. Trust, but verify

- Verification involves using metrics and evidence.
- There are two types: quantitative and qualitative.
    - **Quantitative**: PRs merged, points completed, code reviewed.
        - decisions shouldn’t be based on them alone.
    - **Qualitative**: Helping others, product mindset, etc...
        - these insights depend on truly knowing your team.

### 10. Eventually delegate everything.
- For a manager, every project needs to be completed, automated, delegated, or cancelled.
- The “I can do it faster myself” is **not sustainable** in the long run.
- Every time you do it yourself, you rob someone else from learning and ensure you’ll be doing it forever.

### 11. There is no free lunch when it comes to reducing risk

- Be risk-averse, not risk-paranoid.
- You can’t account for every variable. 
- Some things can’t be anticipated, and overcorrecting may be worse than the original issue.
