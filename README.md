# Learning Notes

Taking notes on books I read and things I learn.

Greatly inspired by **Keyvan Akbary**'s [learning notes](https://github.com/keyvanakbary/learning-notes/).


_Note: These learning notes sometimes contain extensive excerpts from articles and books I have purchased and read. The goal is to keep track of what I read and to help me learn. I always make sure to credit the original authors and I encourage readers to purchase the books. However, if you are the copyright holder and feel uncomfortable seeing these excerpts online, please feel free to contact me, and Iâ€™ll make sure to remove them._
