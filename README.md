# Learning Notes

Taking notes on books I read and things I learn.

Started in 2025 and greatly inspired by **Keyvan Akbary**'s [learning notes](https://github.com/keyvanakbary/learning-notes/).


### Books

* [The Manager's Path: A Guide for Tech Leaders Navigating Growth and Change](books/the-managers-path.md) by **Camille Fournier**, 2017.
