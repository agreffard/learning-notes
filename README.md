# Learning Notes

Taking notes on books I read and things I learn.

Started in 2025 and greatly inspired by **Keyvan Akbary**'s [learning notes](https://github.com/keyvanakbary/learning-notes/).


### Books

- [The Art of Decision-Making: How we Move from Indecision to Smart Choices](books/the-art-of-decision-making.md) by **Joseph Bikart**, 2019.
