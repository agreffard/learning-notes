# Part II. Three mindsets

## Chapter 4. Who we choose to be

All too often in the face of a task, we I’ve quickly to _doing_ without first reflecting on _being_: what _we_ personally bring to the task.

> Be the change you want to see\
> -Mahatma Gandhi

In order to open the space for transformation, we have to change how we think and who we perceive ourselves to be.

Our social and economic structures are a product of our way of thinking.

**Our current crisis requires a total shift in our thinking**. To survive and thrive, we must understand ourselves to be inextricably connected to all nature.

This transformation begins with the individual.

## Chapter 5. Stubborn optimism

Attitudes can be transformed by first identifying our thought patterns, then deliberately cultivating a more constructive approach.

Switch your focus.

When you are faced with the hard realities, look at them with clarity, but also know that you are incredibly lucky to be alive at a time when you can make a transformative difference to the future of all life on earth.

**You are part of the greatest chapter of human achievement in history**. Make this your mental mantra.

When your mind tells you etc. TODO

Tipping points are non linear. We don’t know what is going to make the difference, but we know that in the end systems do shift and all the little actions add up to a new world.

> “Optimism is a state of the mind, not a state of the world”.\
> -Vaclav Havel

Acknowledge the bad news.
Focus on the good news.

Viewing our reality with optimism means recognizing that **another future is possible, not promised**. We have to be optimistic, not because success is guaranteed but because failure is unthinkable.

Optimism empowers you; it drives your desire to engage, to contribute, to make a difference.

Optimism is about **actively proving, through every decision and every action, that we are capable of designing a better future**.

**We need both systemic transformation and individual behavioral changes**. One without the other will not get us to the necessary scale of change at the necessary pace.

## Chapter 6. Endless abundance

Most of us have grown up under the stifling influence of the zero-sum paradigm, the notion that if one person wins, another one has to lose.

It’s all about the mindset. Our mindset is so powerful that it can convince us that a scarcity exists, throwing us into unnecessary competition and thereby objectively creating the scarcity we initially feared.

In circumstances of real (not only perceived) scarcity, our only viable option is collaboration.

Communities respond overwhelmingly with an altruistic spirit of solidarity under the initial common pain and then collaborate to reconstruct and recover afterward.

This is the ultimate scarcity:
- We have **dramatically fewer insects, birds, and mammals** than we did 50 years ago, and **far less forest cover**.
- **Our soils are less productive**
- **Our oceans are less bountiful**
- We are running out of atmospheric space for our greenhouse gas emissions. We are **on the verge of atmospheric tipping points** that are frighteningly unpredictable and irreversible.

We are all on the same boat. A hole at one end of the boat does not mean that only the occupants sitting there will drown. **We all win or lose together**.

The new zero-sum model presupposes collaboration, not competition, as the necessary engine for regenerating the biosphere and creating abundance.

At the individual level, we are called to **enhance collaboration** and **nurture abundance** as a mindset.

We can add creativity, solidarity, innovation, and many other abundant human attributes available to us, endlessly.

Think of Wikipedia, LinkedIn or Waze. Every user contributes to the whole, but the total body of knowledge is larger than the sum of all users.
Everyone contributes, everyone benefits. Collaboration is the name of the game. Shared benefits from endless abundance is the result of the game.

We could imagine a world of “open source everything”.

Another person’s success is not our loss; it is our constantly growing collective success.

**We are entering the next phase of human evolution. We need to prioritize collaboration**.

## Chapter 7. Radical regeneration

We have an urgent responsibility to **replenish ourselves** and **protect ourselves from breaking down**.

Continual personal grounding is key to being able to withstand the daily bombardement of bad news from all sides.

That includes meditation and mindfulness.

**Identify what replenished you and your soul, and do it regularly and intentionally**.

Let’s begin our regenerative mindset shift by acknowledging and internalizing te simple fact the out lives, our very physical survival, depend directly on nature.

Regeneration of nature now needs to be intentional, planned, and well executed at scale.

Nature-deficit disorder. Reconnection to nature is a powerful antidote to anxiety and stress, as well as a counter to physical illness. (See _shinrin-yoku_ - forest bath - as part of the Japanese health system).

With directional intent, we can shift our aspirations from our current extractive growth to a life-sustaining society of regenerative values, principles, and practices.

We will need artists as well as policy experts, farmers as well as leaders of industry, grandmothers as well as inventors, and indigenous leaders as well as scientists.

We have to shift our action compass **from self-centric to nature-aligned**.

When considering an action, we have to ask: _Does it actively contribute to humans and nature thriving together as one integrated system on this planet?_ If yes, green flag. If not, red flag. Period.


# Part III. Ten actions

### Action 1: Let go of the old world.
- Now is the time to make profound shifts on how we live, work, and relate to each other.
- Honor the past, then let it go.
- Thank fossil fuels, retire them, and move on.
- Focus on where you’re going, not on where you’ve been
    - When you can see where you’re going, you won’t be so afraid of losing your grip on the past.
- Build resilience to nostalgia.

- Burst out of your bubble.
- Challenge your own assumptions, and be mindful of misinformation and disinformation.

### Action 2: Face your grief but hold a vision of the future.
- Confusing vision with goals is easy.
    - Goals are critical, but we also need a **vision** to inspire the kind of commitment and energy we will need to get through the difficult years ahead.
    - So hold on to your vision, but remain flexible and adaptive about the route to get there.
- Start with why.
- Imagination is essential. Much of what we imagine to be permanent is more ephemeral than we realize.
- Keep your eyes on what’s to come.

> You may encounter many defeats, but you must not be defeated.\
> -Maya Angelou

### Action 3. Defend the Truth.
- Free your mind. In the end, you are responsible for what you choose to believe in a post-truth world.
- Fight to force your mind down avenues and ways of thinking that you are unused to.
- Learn to distinguish between real science and pseudoscience.
- Don’t give up on climate deniers.

### Action 4: See yourself as a Citizen - Not as a Consumer.
- Reclaim your idea of a good life.
    - Consumerism traps is thinking we can purchase personality.
    - Mass consumption creates a bigger and bigger hole in our lives that we keep trying to fill.
    - We can start intentionally push back. We can change our consumption habits and vote with our money for products that are sustainable.

        - Apply the old-fashioned adage of reduce, reuse, recycle.
        - When we need to buy things, our choices should be informed and enlightened.
- Dematerialize.
    - Less can be more.
    - In the near future, even individuals ownership of cars may cease to exist as the dominant paradigm
        - the transportation we need might be offered by shared vehicles, probably self-driving and certainly electric.
    - One day consumers may come to define themselves not as owners of products but as beneficiaries of systems of service delivery.

### Action 5: Move beyond fossil fuels.
- We must let go of the conviction that fossil fuels are necessary for humanity to thrive in the future.
- Fossil fuels companies are deliberately slowing the transition.
- The urgent shift from fossil fuels must happen in a planned and measured way and not as the result of panic.

- Stand up for 100 percent renewable energy.
    - make a time-bound, ambitious plan.
    - **We humans tend to overestimate what we can achieve in a year and underestimate what we can achieve in ten.**

### Action 7 : invest in a clean energy.

### Action 8: Use technology responsibly.

### Action 9: Build gender equality.


### Action 10 : Engage in politics


# Conclusion


## What you can do now


### Right now

- **Take a deep breath** and decide that collectively we can do this, and that you will play your part. You will be a hopeful visionary for humanity through these dark days. From this moment, despair ends and tactics begin.
of the politics of the future.
- **Decide that you will be part of the politics of the future**. You will vote for, campaign for, and support who champion emissions reductions. Reject the politics of nostalgia. For the next ten years, this will be your number-one political priority.
- **Commit to reducing your impact on the climate** by more than half of what it is today by 2030. Aim for 60 percent. Just because right now you don't know how you will do so does not need to stop you. We are all learning.


### Today or tomorrow

- Determine where your principal elected officials stand on climate change; **write to them about your commitments and let them know**. Tell them you are watching.
- Choose at least **one day of the week to go meat-free**, and decide how soon you will add more days to that
commitment.
- **Think big**. How do you most impact climate change, and what big things can you do to effect a regenerative future?
- **Tell others about your commitments**, in person or on social media. Don't be shy! Invite others to follow suit. Your example will motivate them.

### This week

- **Share your personal plan to reduce emissions** by more than half with your partner, kids, and friends, and invite them to do so as well. **Preserving the future of all life should be joyful. Have fun with it**.
- Take some actions and stick to them over time-it will give you momentum. Reduce daily energy use, bike instead of driving a car, switch your energy supplier to 100 percent clean. It's all good and all needs doing. Consider what else you can do, while remembering there is
still much to be done.
- **Go outside and look around**. This world is damaged and hurting, but it is also beautiful and intact and whole. Pay attention to something you have forgotten-emerging leaves in the spring or frost on dead leaves in winter. Feel the gratitude we owe the Earth for her bounty and beauty.

### This month

- Find out who in your vicinity is organizing political action involving climate change. **Attend meetings and meet the concerned citizens**. Go to demonstrations and marches! Allow yourself to be inspired by the miracle of committed groups intent on changing the world.
- **Start a conversation with someone who is not active on climate change** with a view toward understanding their stance and gently enlarging their awareness of the crisis from their perspective.
- **Enact your commitments**: What precisely will you do this year? How will it affect you and your family? How will you begin to apply the changes you plan to make?
- **Challenge your consumerism**. Look at what you have bought, and ask yourself whether it brings you joy. Question your impulses to buy more, and begin to see how liberating it is to buy less.
- **Start a mindfulness practice**, perhaps a breathing exercise of gratitude. Do it every day, if only for a few minutes. Learn to create a gap of light between yourself, the world, and your reactions.
- **Plant trees**. As many as you can. Look for a local group doing tree planting. Get out there when you can, and when you can't, support others to do so.
Understand your privilege in relation to others, and com- mit to helping level the playing field for all.

### This year

- **Be political in your daily life**. Seek collective opportunities to advance the cause of emissions reductions. It will inspire you and help you feel you are part of a shared endeavor. Engage regularly in direct action if that is sible where you live. VOTE!
- **Be consistent**. You may have changed your electricity supply to 100 percent renewable energy, rethought your commute, changed your air travel habits, and altered diet. If you can sustain your effort for the first year, you stand a good chance of doing so every year. **Recognize your accomplishment**.

### By 2030

- Deliver on your plan to cut your emissions by more than half. Celebrate your achievement.
Finance others to plant more trees as a symbol of the fact
that you still have some way to go. Trees are good, and the world needs more of them.
- Ensure you have voted in line with these priorities in national and regional elections and been vocal about the fact that you have done so.
- Continue to practice the other new habits you have developed.
Encourage those closest to you-family, friends, loved ones-to be climate conscious.
- Start the plan to reduce your emissions again by more than half over the next decade.



### Before 2050

- Be at net-zero emissions, having been part of the generation that chose a better future for all of us.
