# Part I. Two worlds

## Chapter 1. Choosing Our Future

In deciding what kind of works we and future generations will live in, we don’t have many options. **We have in fact only two, both of which are set out in the Paris Agreement**.

We present two scenarios. One or the other will become our reality.

To have at least a 50 percent chance of success (which in itself is an unacceptably high level of risk), we must:
- cut global emissions to half their current levels by 2030
- half again by 2040
- finally to net zero by 2050 at the very latest.

A change of this magnitude would require **major transformations in almost every area of life and work**.

### Chapter 2. The world we are creating

It is 2050.\
No efforts were made to control emissions.\
We are heading for a world that will be **more than 3 degrees warmer by 2100**.

- **The air is hot**, heavy, and clogged with particulate pollution.
- You often wear a mask to protect yourself from **air pollution**.
- Most of the forests are either logged or consumed by **wildfire**.

- No one knows what the future holds for their children and grandchildren.
- **Corals are now almost gone**.
- There is **no summer Arctic sea ice** anymore.
- Costal cities in Bangladesh, Mexico, the United States, and elsewhere have seen a surge in **extreme hurricanes** and **tropical storms**.
- Because of rising water levels, some part of the world must **evacuate to higher ground**.
- It can take weeks or months for basic food and water relief to reach areas pummeled by extreme floods.
- Diseases such as **malaria, dengue, cholera, respiratory illnesses** and **malnutrition** are rampant.
- **Droughts and heat waves** inland have created a special hell.
- Vast regions have succumbed to severe **aridification** or even **desertification**.
- These places **can barely support human life**.
- If you live in Paris, you endure summer temperatures that regularly rise to **44 degrees Celsius**.
- For 2 billion people who live in the hottest parts of the world, temperatures skyrocket to** 60 degrees Celsius** forty-five days per year.
- Mass migrations to less hit rural areas are beset by a host of **refugee problems**, **civil unrest**, and bloodshed over **diminished water availability**.
- Inland glaciers around the world are quickly disappearing. Now there are either torrential rains leading to **flooding** or **prolonged droughts**.
- There are **conflicts over water**.
- The taps in nearly all public facilities are locked.
- More people are starving than ever before.
- The food supply is in general **highly unpredictable**.
- **Disasters and wars rage**, choking off trade routes.
- Entire regions suffer from **epidemics of stunting and malnutrition**.
- **Infant mortality** has rocketed.
- **Food riots, coups, and civil wars** are common.
- **Stock markets are crashing**, currencies are wildly fluctuating, and the European Union has disbanded.
- Most countries’ armies are now just highly militarized **border patrols**.
- The news has taken a strange, seemingly controlled turn toward **distorting reality** and spinning a **falsely positive narrative**.
- Diseases spread by **mosquitos and ticks** are rampant as these species flourish.
- **The demise of the human species is being discussed**.

### Chapter 3. The world we must create

It is 2050.\
We have been successful at halving emissions every decade since 2020.\
We are heading for a world that will be **no more than 1,5 degrees Celsius warmer by 2100**.

- **Trees** are everywhere.
- **New electric railways** crisscross interior landscapes.
- Most of our energy now comes from **renewable sources** like wind, solar, geothermal, and hydro.
- **Smart tech** prevents unnecessary energy consumption.
- Homes and buildings all over the world are becoming **self-sustaining** far beyond their electrical needs.
- We’ve successfully rebuilt, reorganized, and restructures our lives to live in a **more localized way**.
- Many people **work from home**.
- Resources and responsibilities are **shared** now.
- We transitioned to **regenerative farming practices**.
- You buy most of your food from **small local farmers and producers**.
- **Food is expensive**, consuming up to 30 percent of household budgets, which is why **growing your own** is a necessity.
- Food seems to be growing everywhere (community gardens, rooftops, balconies, schools, vertical gardens. …).
- **Animal protein air dairy products have basically disappeared** from our diets.
- **Internal combustion engines are off the road**.
- People from rural areas **moved to the cities**.

    - Glaciers and Arctic ice are still melting.
    - Sea is still rising.
    - Severe droughts and desertification are occurring in the western United States, the Mediterranean, and parts of China.
    - Extreme weather and resource degradation multiply disparities in income, public health, food security and water availability.
    - The ongoing refugee situation has been escalating for decades. But we stopped calling it a crisis. Countries agreed on guidelines for managing refugees influxes.

### Conclusion

Future generations will most likely look back at this moment as **the single most signifiant turning point for action**.

What is needed now is a steadfast **commitment to the task** and an understanding that **failure is not an option**.

Now we must move toward understanding our shared existence on this planet, not because it is a nice addendum to what we do but because it is a matter of survival.

This is not the quest of one nation. This time **it’s up to all of us, all of the nations and peoples of the world**.

Humanity is capable of coming together to do this.

When the eyes of our children, and their children, look straight into ours, and they ask us “What did you do?” our answers cannot just be that we did everything we could. There is really only one answer. _We did everything that was necessary._

Let it be **a story of great adventure, against overwhelming odds**.

# Part II. Three mindsets

## Chapter 4. Who we choose to be

All too often in the face of a task, we I’ve quickly to _doing_ without first reflecting on _being_: what _we_ personally bring to the task.

> Be the change you want to see\
> -Mahatma Gandhi

In order to open the space for transformation, we have to change how we think and who we perceive ourselves to be.

Our social and economic structures are a product of our way of thinking.

**Our current crisis requires a total shift in our thinking**. To survive and thrive, we must understand ourselves to be inextricably connected to all nature.

This transformation begins with the individual.

## Chapter 5. Stubborn optimism

Attitudes can be transformed by first identifying our thought patterns, then deliberately cultivating a more constructive approach.

Switch your focus.

When you are faced with the hard realities, look at them with clarity, but also know that you are incredibly lucky to be alive at a time when you can make a transformative difference to the future of all life on earth.

**You are part of the greatest chapter of human achievement in history**. Make this your mental mantra.

When your mind tells you etc. TODO

Tipping points are non linear. We don’t know what is going to make the difference, but we know that in the end systems do shift and all the little actions add up to a new world.

> “Optimism is a state of the mind, not a state of the world”.\
> -Vaclav Havel

Acknowledge the bad news.
Focus on the good news.

Viewing our reality with optimism means recognizing that **another future is possible, not promised**. We have to be optimistic, not because success is guaranteed but because failure is unthinkable.

Optimism empowers you; it drives your desire to engage, to contribute, to make a difference.

Optimism is about **actively proving, through every decision and every action, that we are capable of designing a better future**.

**We need both systemic transformation and individual behavioral changes**. One without the other will not get us to the necessary scale of change at the necessary pace.

## Chapter 6. Endless abundance

Most of us have grown up under the stifling influence of the zero-sum paradigm, the notion that if one person wins, another one has to lose.

It’s all about the mindset. Our mindset is so powerful that it can convince us that a scarcity exists, throwing us into unnecessary competition and thereby objectively creating the scarcity we initially feared.

In circumstances of real (not only perceived) scarcity, our only viable option is collaboration.

Communities respond overwhelmingly with an altruistic spirit of solidarity under the initial common pain and then collaborate to reconstruct and recover afterward.

This is the ultimate scarcity:
- We have **dramatically fewer insects, birds, and mammals** than we did 50 years ago, and **far less forest cover**.
- **Our soils are less productive**
- **Our oceans are less bountiful**
- We are running out of atmospheric space for our greenhouse gas emissions. We are **on the verge of atmospheric tipping points** that are frighteningly unpredictable and irreversible.

We are all on the same boat. A hole at one end of the boat does not mean that only the occupants sitting there will drown. **We all win or lose together**.

The new zero-sum model presupposes collaboration, not competition, as the necessary engine for regenerating the biosphere and creating abundance.

At the individual level, we are called to **enhance collaboration** and **nurture abundance** as a mindset.

We can add creativity, solidarity, innovation, and many other abundant human attributes available to us, endlessly.

Think of Wikipedia, LinkedIn or Waze. Every user contributes to the whole, but the total body of knowledge is larger than the sum of all users.
Everyone contributes, everyone benefits. Collaboration is the name of the game. Shared benefits from endless abundance is the result of the game.

We could imagine a world of “open source everything”.

Another person’s success is not our loss; it is our constantly growing collective success.

**We are entering the next phase of human evolution. We need to prioritize collaboration**.

## Chapter 7. Radical regeneration

We have an urgent responsibility to **replenish ourselves** and **protect ourselves from breaking down**.

Continual personal grounding is key to being able to withstand the daily bombardement of bad news from all sides.

That includes meditation and mindfulness.

**Identify what replenished you and your soul, and do it regularly and intentionally**.

Let’s begin our regenerative mindset shift by acknowledging and internalizing te simple fact the out lives, our very physical survival, depend directly on nature.

Regeneration of nature now needs to be intentional, planned, and well executed at scale.

Nature-deficit disorder. Reconnection to nature is a powerful antidote to anxiety and stress, as well as a counter to physical illness. (See _shinrin-yoku_ - forest bath - as part of the Japanese health system).

With directional intent, we can shift our aspirations from our current extractive growth to a life-sustaining society of regenerative values, principles, and practices.

We will need artists as well as policy experts, farmers as well as leaders of industry, grandmothers as well as inventors, and indigenous leaders as well as scientists.

We have to shift our action compass **from self-centric to nature-aligned**.

When considering an action, we have to ask: _Does it actively contribute to humans and nature thriving together as one integrated system on this planet?_ If yes, green flag. If not, red flag. Period.


# Part III. Ten actions

### Action 1: Let go of the old world.

    - So hold on to your vision, but remain flexible and adaptive about the route to get there.
- Start with why.
- Imagination is essential. Much of what we imagine to be permanent is more ephemeral than we realize.

    - One day consumers may come to define themselves not as owners of products but as beneficiaries of systems of service delivery.

### Action 5: Move beyond fossil fuels.
- We must let go of the conviction that fossil fuels are necessary for humanity to thrive in the future.
- Fossil fuels companies are deliberately slowing the transition.
- The urgent shift from fossil fuels must happen in a planned and measured way and not as the result of panic.

- Stand up for 100 percent renewable energy.
    - make a time-bound, ambitious plan.

# Conclusion


## What you can do now


### Right now

- **Take a deep breath** and decide that collectively we can do this, and that you will play your part. You will be a hopeful visionary for humanity through these dark days. From this moment, despair ends and tactics begin.
of the politics of the future.
- **Decide that you will be part of the politics of the future**. You will vote for, campaign for, and support who champion emissions reductions. Reject the politics of nostalgia. For the next ten years, this will be your number-one political priority.
- **Commit to reducing your impact on the climate** by more than half of what it is today by 2030. Aim for 60 percent. Just because right now you don't know how you will do so does not need to stop you. We are all learning.


### Today or tomorrow

- Determine where your principal elected officials stand on climate change; **write to them about your commitments and let them know**. Tell them you are watching.
- Choose at least **one day of the week to go meat-free**, and decide how soon you will add more days to that
commitment.
- **Think big**. How do you most impact climate change, and what big things can you do to effect a regenerative future?
- **Tell others about your commitments**, in person or on social media. Don't be shy! Invite others to follow suit. Your example will motivate them.

### This week

- **Share your personal plan to reduce emissions** by more than half with your partner, kids, and friends, and invite them to do so as well. **Preserving the future of all life should be joyful. Have fun with it**.
- Take some actions and stick to them over time-it will give you momentum. Reduce daily energy use, bike instead of driving a car, switch your energy supplier to 100 percent clean. It's all good and all needs doing. Consider what else you can do, while remembering there is
still much to be done.
- **Go outside and look around**. This world is damaged and hurting, but it is also beautiful and intact and whole. Pay attention to something you have forgotten-emerging leaves in the spring or frost on dead leaves in winter. Feel the gratitude we owe the Earth for her bounty and beauty.

### This month

- Find out who in your vicinity is organizing political action involving climate change. **Attend meetings and meet the concerned citizens**. Go to demonstrations and marches! Allow yourself to be inspired by the miracle of committed groups intent on changing the world.
- **Start a conversation with someone who is not active on climate change** with a view toward understanding their stance and gently enlarging their awareness of the crisis from their perspective.
- **Enact your commitments**: What precisely will you do this year? How will it affect you and your family? How will you begin to apply the changes you plan to make?
- **Challenge your consumerism**. Look at what you have bought, and ask yourself whether it brings you joy. Question your impulses to buy more, and begin to see how liberating it is to buy less.
- **Start a mindfulness practice**, perhaps a breathing exercise of gratitude. Do it every day, if only for a few minutes. Learn to create a gap of light between yourself, the world, and your reactions.
- **Plant trees**. As many as you can. Look for a local group doing tree planting. Get out there when you can, and when you can't, support others to do so.
Understand your privilege in relation to others, and com- mit to helping level the playing field for all.

### This year

- **Be political in your daily life**. Seek collective opportunities to advance the cause of emissions reductions. It will inspire you and help you feel you are part of a shared endeavor. Engage regularly in direct action if that is sible where you live. VOTE!
- **Be consistent**. You may have changed your electricity supply to 100 percent renewable energy, rethought your commute, changed your air travel habits, and altered diet. If you can sustain your effort for the first year, you stand a good chance of doing so every year. **Recognize your accomplishment**.

### By 2030

- Deliver on your plan to cut your emissions by more than half. Celebrate your achievement.
Finance others to plant more trees as a symbol of the fact
that you still have some way to go. Trees are good, and the world needs more of them.
- Ensure you have voted in line with these priorities in national and regional elections and been vocal about the fact that you have done so.
- Continue to practice the other new habits you have developed.
Encourage those closest to you-family, friends, loved ones-to be climate conscious.
- Start the plan to reduce your emissions again by more than half over the next decade.



### Before 2050

- Be at net-zero emissions, having been part of the generation that chose a better future for all of us.
