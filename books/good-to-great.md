# Chapter 2: Level 5 leadership

Level 5 hierarchy:
- **Level 5 - level 5 executive**: builds enduring greatness through a paradoxical blend of personal humility and professional will.
- **Level 4 - effective leader**: catalyzes commitment to and vigorous pursuit of a clear and compelling vision, stimulating higher performance standards.
- **Level 3 - competent manager**: organizes people and resources toward the effective and efficient pursuit of predetermined objectives.
- **Level 2 - contributing team** member: contributes individual capabilities to the achievement of group objectives and works effectively with others in a group setting.
- **Level 1 - highly capable** individual: makes productive contributions through talent, knowledge, skills, and good work habits.


Level 5 leaders **channel their ego needs away from themselves** and into the larger goal of building a great company.

They are incredibly ambitious, but their ambition is first and foremost for the institution, not themselves.

## Humility + will

Level 5 leaders are a study in duality:
- modest and willful
- humble and fearless

Famous exemples:
- Abraham Lincoln
- Colman Mockler, CEO of Gillette from 1975 to 1991


## Ambition for the company: setting up successors for success

Level 5 leaders want to see the company even **more successful in the next generation**, comfortable with the idea that most people won’t even know that the roots of that success trace back to their efforts.


## Unwavering resolve… to do what must be done

Level 5 leadership is not just about humility and modesty. It is equally about ferocious resolve, an almost stoic determination to do whatever needs to be done to make the company great.

Level 5 leaders are fanatically driven, infected with an incurable **need to produce results**.


## The window and the mirror

Level 5 leaders:
- **look out the window** to apportion credit to factors outside themselves **when things go well**
- **look in the mirror** to apportion responsibility, never blaming bad luck **when things go poorly**



## Summary: the 2 sides of Level 5 leadership


1. **Professional will**
    - Creates superb results
    - Demonstrates an unwavering resolve to do whatever must be done to produce the best long-term results, no matter how difficult
    - Sets the standard of building an enduring great company; will settle for nothing less
    - Looks in the mirror, not out the window, to apportion responsibility for poor results, never blaming other people, external factors, or bad luck

2. **Personal humility**
    - Demonstrates a compelling modesty; shunning public adoration; never boastful
    Acts with quiet, calm determination; relies principally on inspired standards, not inspiring charisma, to motivate.
    - Channels ambition into the company, not the self; sets up successors for even greater success in the next generation
    - Looks out the window, not in the mirror, to apportion credit for the success of the company: to other people, external factors, and good luck.


## Chapter 3 - First who… then what


The good-to-great leaders understood 3 simple truths:
1. If you begin with **who**, rather than what, you can more easily **adapt to a changing world**.
    - _“Hey, I got on the bus because of who else is on it; if we need to change direction to be more successful, fine with me”_
2. If you have the right people on the bus, the problem of how to motivate and manage people largely goes away.
    - The right people will be **self-motivated** by the inner drive to produce the best results and to be part of creating something great.
3. If you have the wrong people, it doesn’t matter whether you discover the right direction, you still don’t have a great company.
    - **Great vision without great people is irrelevant**.


“Who” questions come before “what” questions. Before vision, strategy, tactics, organizational structure or technology.


TODO p47

## It’s who you pay, not how you pay them

We found no systematic pattern linking executive compensation to the process of going from good to great.

The right people will do the right things and deliver the best results they’re capable of, regardless of the incentive system.

The purpose of a compensation system should be to **get the right people on the bus** in the first place, and to **keep them there** (and should not be to get the right behaviors from the wrong people).


In determining the right people, the good-to-great companies placed greater weight on **character attributes** than on specific education background, practical skills, specialized knowledge, or work experience.

They view these traits as **more teachable/learnable**, whereas dimensions like character, work ethic, basic intelligence, dedication to fulfilling commitments and values are more ingrained.

## Rigorous, not ruthless

- To be ruthless means hacking and cutting l, especially in difficult times, or wantonly firing people without any thoughtful consideration.

- To be rigorous means consistently applying exacting standard at all times and at all levels, especially in upper management.

To be rigorous, not ruthless, means that the best people need not worry about their positions and can concentrate fully on their work.

Rigorous in a good-to-great company applies first at the top, focused on those who hold the largest burden of responsibility.

## How to be rigorous



3 practical disciplines:

1. **When in doubt, don’t hire, keep looking**.
    - No company can grow revenues consistently faster than its ability to get enough of the right people to implement that growth and still become a great company. (= *“Packard’s law”*)
2. **When you know you need to make a people change, act.**
    - The best people don’t need to be managed. Guided, taught, led, yes. But not tightly managed.
    - Letting the wrong people hang around is unfair to all the right people, as they inevitably find themselves compensating for the inadequacies of the wrong people. Worst, **it can drive away the best people**. Strong performers are intrinsically motivated by performance, and when they see their efforts impeded by carrying extra weight, they eventually become frustrated.
    - The good-to-great leaders did not pursue an expedient “try a lot of people and keep who works”. Instead, they adopted the following approach: “let’s take the time to make rigorous A+ selections right up front. If we get it right, we’ll do everything we can to try to keep them on board for a long time. If we make a mistake, then we’ll confront that fact so that we can get on with our work and they can get on with their lives”.
    - The good-to-great leaders, however, **would not rush to judgement**. Often, they invest substantial effort in determining whether they had someone in the wrong seat before concluding whether they had someone on the bus entirely.
3. **Put your best people on your biggest opportunities**, not your biggest problems.
    - Corollary: if you sell off your problems, don’t sell off your best people.


# Chapter 4 - Confront the brutal facts (yet never lose faith)

## Facts are better than dreams


The good-to-great companies displayed 2 distinctive firms of discipline thought:

1. They infused the entire process with the brutal facts of reality
2. They developed a simple, yet deeply insightful, frame of reference for all decisions.


You cannot make a series of good decisions without first confronting the brutal facts.

The moment a leader allows himself to become the primary reality people worry about, rather than reality being the primary reality, you have a recipe for mediocrity, or worse.

## How to create a climate where the truth is heard


- **Lead with questions, not answers.**
    - Use questions only to **gain understanding**, not as a form of manipulation (*“don’t you agree with me?”*) or as a way to blame or put down others (*“why did you mess this up?”*)
    - Have the humility to grasp the fact that **you do not yet understand** enough to have the answers.
- **Engage in dialogue end debate**, not coercion.
- **Conduct autopsies, without blame**.
    - If you have the right people on the bus, you should almost never need to assign blame but need only to search for understanding and learning.
- Build “red flags” mechanisms.

# The hedgehog concept (simplicity within the three circles)

**The three circles**:
- What you can be the best in the world
- What drives your economic engine
- What you are deeply passionate about

A **hedgehog concept** is not a goal to be the best, a strategy to be the best, an intention to be the best, a plan yo be the best. **It is an understanding of what you can be the best at**.


## Insight into your economic engine - what is your denominator?

TODO - P104

A hedgehog concept:
- simplifies a complex world
- makes decisions much easier.

It’s an **inherent iterative process**, not an event.

A useful mechanism for moving the process along is a device we called **the Council**:

- The Council exists as a device to **gain understanding** about important issues facing the organization
- The Council is assembled and used by the leading executive and usually consists of **5 to 12 people**
- Each Council member has the **ability to argue and debate** in search of understanding, not from the egoistic need to win a point or protect a parochial interest
- Each Council member **retains the respect of every other Council member**, without exception.
- Council members come from a range of perspectives, but each member **has a deep knowledge** about some aspect of the organization and/or the environment in which it operates
- The Council includes key members of the management team but is **not limited to members of the management team**, nor is every executive automatically a member
- The Council is a **standing body, not an ad hoc committee** assembled for a specific project
- The Council **meets periodically**, as much as once a week or as frequently as once per quarter
- The Council **does not seek consensus**, recognizing that consensus decisions are often at odds with intelligent decisions The responsibility for the final decision remains with the leading executive.
- The Council is an **informal body**, not listed on any organization chart or in any formal documents.
- The Council can have **a range of possible names**, usually quite innocuous (strategic thinking group, executive council, etc)


# Chapter 6 - A culture of discipline


Most companies build their bureaucratic rules to manage the small percentage of wrong people on the bus, which in turn drives away the right people on the bus, which then increases the percentage of wrong people on the bus, which increases the need for more bureaucracy to compensate for incompetence and lack of discipline, which then further the right people away, and so forth.

**Avoid bureaucracy and hierarchy** and instead **create a culture of discipline**.

- Build a culture around the idea of **freedom and responsibility, within a framework**
    - The good-to-great companies built a consistent system with clear constraints, but they also have people freedom and responsibility within the framework of that system.
    - They hired self-disciplined people who didn’t need to be managed, and then managed the system, not the people.
- Fill that culture with **self-disciplined people** who are willing to go to extreme lengths to fulfill their responsibilities.
- Don’t confuse a culture of discipline with a tyrannical disciplinarian.
- Adhere with great consistency to the hedgehog concept.


## Start a “stop doing” list

TODO

## Chapter 7 - Technology accelerators


When used right, technology becomes an **accelerator of momentum, not a creator of it**.

The good-to-great companies never began their transitions with pioneering technology, for the simple reason that **you cannot make good use of technology until you know which technologies are relevant** (= those that link directly to the three intersecting circles of the hedgehog concept).

TODO p153

Technology by itself is never a primary cause of either greatness or decline.

Thoughtless reliance on technology is a liability, not an asset.


# Chapter 8 - The flywheel and the doom loop

No matter how dramatic the end result, **the good-to-great transformations never happened in one fell swoop**.

There was no single defining action, no grand program, no one killer innovation, no solitary lucky break, no wrenching revolution.


Good to great comes about by a **cumulative process**: step by step, action by action, decision by decision, turn by turn of the flywheel, that adds up to sustained and spectacular results.


From the outside, they look like dramatic, revolutionary breakthroughs, but from the inside, they feel completely different, more like an **organic development process**. There was no miracle moment.
