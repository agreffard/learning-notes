# Part I. OKRs in Action

## 4. Superpower #1: Focus and Commit to Priorities

Measuring what matters begins with the question: _What is the most important for the next three (or six, twelve) months?_

- Successful organizations _focus_ on the **handful of initiatives** that can **make a real difference**, deferring less urgent ones.
- Their leaders **commit** to those choices in word and deed.

### In the Beginning...

- Senior leadership must personally commit to the process.
- You've got to say "This is what we're doing", and then you have to model it.
    - If you don't model it, no one's going to do it.

### Communicate with clarity

- Top-line goals must be clearly understood throughout the organization.
- Leaders must get across the _why_ as well as the _what_.
    - People need more than milestones for motivation.
    - They are thirsting for **meaning**, to understand how their goals relate to the mission.
> When you are tired of saying it, people are starting to hear it. - Jeff Weiner (LinkedIn CEO)

### Key Results: Care and Feeding

**Objectives** and **key results** are the yin and yang of goal setting:
- Objectives are the **principle** and **vision**
    - stuff of inspiration and far hoirizons
- Key results are the **practice** and **execution**.
    - more earth-bound and metric-driven
    - typically include hard numbers
    - the are the levers you pull, the marks you hit to achieve the goal.
    - If an objective is well framed, **3 to 5 KRs** will usually be adequate.
        - Too many can dilute focus and obscure progress.
    - Each key result should be a **challenge** in its own right.
        - If you're certain you're going to nail it, you're probably not pushing hard enough.

### What, How, When

- It's the shorter-term goals that drive the actual work. They keep annual plans honest, and executed.
- Clear-cut time frames intensify our focus and commitment.
- A three-months horizon curbs procrastination and leads to real performance gains.
- But there is no one-size-fits-all. The best OKR cadence is the one that fits the context and culture of your business.

### Pairing Key Results

- The more ambitious the OKR, the greater the risk of overlooking a vital criterion.
- To safeguard quality while pushing for quantitative deliverables, one solution is to **pair key results** to **measure both effect and counter-effect**.

#### Key results paired for Quantity and Quality:

| Quantity Goal | Quality Goal | Result |
| - | -- | -- | 
| 3 new features | Fewer than 5 bugs per feature in QA testing | Developers will write cleaner code.
| $50M in Q1 sales | $10M in Q1 maintenance contracts | Sustained attention will increase customer success
| 10 sales calls | 2 new orders | lead quality will improve |

### The Perfect and the Good

> Don't allow the perfect to be the enemy of the good. - Voltaire
- An OKR can be modified or even scrapped at any point inits cycle.
- OKRs are **works in progress**, not commandments chiseled in stone.
- Key results should be **succinct**, **specific**, and **measurable**.
- Completion of all key results must result in attainment of the objective.

#### An OKR Quality Continuum

TODO

### Less Is More

> Innovation means saying no to 1000 things. - Steve Jobs

- The ideal number of quarterly OKRs will range **between 3 and 5**.
    - Too many objectives can blur our focus on what counts, or distract us into chasing the next shiny thing.
- The one thing an OKR should provide if **focus**.
    - Each time you make a commitment, you forfeit your chance to commit to something else.
- Top-line objectives must be **significant**.
    - They are a set of stringently curated goals that merit special attention and will move people forward in the here and now.

## 7. Superpower #2: Align and Connect for Teamwork.

> We don't hire smart people to tell them what to do. We hire smart people so they can tell us what to do. - Steve Jobs

- **Public goals** are more likely to be attained than goals held in private.
- In an OKR system, the most junior staff can look at everyone's goals, on up to the CEO.
- **Transparency** seeds **collaboration**.
    - Work relationships are deepened, even transformed.

### The Same Page

- Once top-line objetives are set, the real work begins.
- Managers and contributors tie their day-to-day activities to the organization's vision. This is **alignment**.
- Companies with highly aligned employees are more than twice as likely to be top performers.
- As a species, we crave **connection**.
    - In the workplace, we're naturally curious about what our leaders are doing and hos our work weaves into theirs.
    - OKRs are the vehicle of choice for vertical alignment.

### The Grand Cascade

- In the bygone business world, work was strictly driven from the top. Cascading makes an operation more coherent.
- But when _all_ objectives are cascaded, the process can degrade into a mechanical exercise with 4 advers effects:
    - **A loss of agility**:
        - everyone waits for the waterfall to trickle down from above
        - each goal cycle can take weeks or months to administer
        - quarterly OKRs may prove impractical
    - **A lack of flexibility**:
        - people are reluctant to revise goals mid-cycle
        - over time, the system grows onerous to maintain
    - **Marginalized contributors**:
        - contributors will hesitate to share goal-related concerns or promising ideas
    - **One-dimensional linkages**:
        - it's less effective in coinnecting peers hoirizontally, across departmental lines

### Bottoms Up!

- Because OKRs are transparent, they can be shared without cascading them in lockstep.
- Multiple levels of hierarchy can be skipped over.
- To avoid compulsive, soul-killing overalignment, healthy organisations encourange some goals to emerge **from the bottom up**.
- People in the trenches are usually in touch with impending changes early:
    - salespeople understand shifting customer demands before management does
    - financial analysts are the earliest to know when the fundamentals of a business change
    - etc
- Micromanagement is mismanagement.
- A healthy OKR environment strikes a balance between:
    - **alignment** and **autonomy**
    - **common purpose** and **creative latitude**
- An optimal OKR system frees contributors to set at least some of their own objectives and most of all of theur key results.
- People who choose their destination will own a deeper awareness of what it takes to get there.
- By loosening the reins and backing people to find _their_ right answers, **we help everybody win**.
- High functioning teams thrive on a creative tension between top-down and bottom-up goal setting, a mix of aligned ans unalkigned OKRs.

### Cross-functional Coordination

- Unacknowledged dependencies remain the number one cause of project slippage.
- The cure is **lateral, cross-functional connectivity**, peer-to-peer and team-to-team.
- Connected companies are quicker companies.
- When goals are public and visible to all, a "team of teams" can attack trouble spots wherever they surface.
- **Transparency** creates a very clear signal for everyone.
    - You kick off virtuous cycles that reinforce your ability to actually get your work done.

## 10. Superpower #3: Track for Accountability

> In God we trust; all others must bring data. -W.Edwards Deming

- OKRs can be **tracked**, then **revised** or **adapted** as circumstances dictate.
- OKRs are living, breathing organisms.
- Their life cycle in three phases:
    - **The Setup**
        - Contributors are more engaged when they can actually see how their work contributes to tyhe company's success.
        - TODO
    - **Midlife Tracking**
        - OKRs are adaptable by nature.
        - They're meant to be guardrails, not chains or blinders.
        - We have 4 options at any point in the cycle:
            - **Continue**: if a green zone (" on track") goal isn't broken, don't fix it.
            - **Update**: Modify a yellow zone ("needs attention") key result or objective to respond to changes in the workflow or external environment.
                - What could be done differently to get the goal on track?
                - Does it need a revised timeline?
                - Do we back-burner other initiatives to free up resources for this one?
            - **Start**: Launch a new OKR mid-cycle, whenever the need arises.
            - **Stop**: When a red zone ("at risk") goal has outlived its usefulness, the best solution may be to drop it.
        - A real-time dashboard can help quantify progress and flag what needs attention.
        - OKRs can stop us from persisting in the wrong direction.
        - Our goals are servants to our purpose, not the other way around.
        - When an objective gets dropped, it's important to **notify everyone** depending on it.
        - For best results, OKRs are **scrutinized several times per quarter** by contributors and their managers.
    - **Wrap-up: Rinse and Repeat**
        - **Scoring**:
            - We mark what we've achieved and we address how we might do it differently next time.
                - A low score forces reassessment:
                    - _Is the objective still worth pursuing?_
                    - _What can we change to achieve it?_
                - The simplest way to score an objective is by **averaging** the percentage completion reates of its associated key results.
                - Goole uses a scale of 0.0 to 1.0:
                    - 0.7 to 1.0 = Green. "We delivered".
                    - 0.4 to 0.6 = Yellow. "We made progress, but fell short of completion".
                    - 0.0 to 0.3 = Red. "We failed to make real progress".
        - **Self-assessment**
            - Objective data is enhanced by the goal setter's **thoughtful, subjective judgement**.
            - Googlers are encouraged to use their OKRs in self-assessmnets: as **guides**, not grades.
            - The point of objectives and key results, after all, is to get everyone working on the right things.
            - Some people will grade themselves too harshly, others may need to be challenged.
                - A team leader will jump in and calibrate.
                - At the end, the numbers are less important than contextual feedback and a broader discussion within the team.
            - Self-assessments drive a superior goal-setting process for the next quarter.
                - There are no judgements, only learnings.
        - **Reflection**
            > We do not learn from experience. We learn from reflecting on experience. - John Dewey
            - The key to satisfaction:
                - Set aggressive goals
                - Achieve most of them
                - Pause to reflect on the achievement
                - Repeat the cycle.   
            - Here are some reflection for closing out an OKR cycle:
                - _Did I accomplish all my objectives? If so, what contributed to my success?_
                - _If not, what obstacles did I encounter?_
                - _If I were to rewrite a goal achieved in full, what would I change?_
                - _What have I learned that might alter my approach to the next cycle's OKRs?_
            - One more thing:
                - Take a breath to savor your progress.
                - Throw a party with the team to celebrate your growing OKR superpowers.
                - You've earned it.


## 12. Superpower #4: Stretch for Amazing

> The biggest risk of all is not taking one. - Mellody Hobson

- OKRs push us far beyond our comfort zones:
    - They lead us to achievements on the border between abilities and dreams.
    - They unearth fresh capacity
    - They hatch more creative solutions
    - They revolutionize business models.
- Two OKR baskets:
    - **Committed objectives**
    - **Aspirational objectives**
    - TODO

### The Gospel of 10x

TODO Gmail story

### Stretch Variables

- Stretch your team too fast and too far, and it may snap.
- Leaders must convey two things: the **importance of the outcome**, and the **belief that it's attainable**.
- There is no magic number for the right stretch. But consider:
    - How can your team create maximum value?
    - What would _amazing_ look like?

# Part II. The New World of Work

## 15. Continuous Performance Management: OKRs and CFRs

> Talking can transform minds, which can transform behaviors, which can transform institutions. - Sheryl Sandberg

- Annual performance reviews are costly, exhausting, and mostly futile.
    - On average = 7.5 hours of manager time for each direct report.
- Individuals cannot be reduced to numbers.

> Not everything can that be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted. - Albert Einstein

- Alternative: **Continuous performance management**, with an instrument called **CFR**:
    - **Conversations**: an authentic, richly textured exchange between manager and contributor, aimed at driving performance
    - **Feedback**: bidirectional or networked communication among peers to evaluate progress and guide future improvement
    - **Recognition**: expressions of appreciation to deserving individuals for contributions of all sizes
=
- CFRs champion **transparency**, **accountability**, **empowerment**, **teamwork**.
- They give OKRs their **human voice**.
- OKRs anf CFRs are mutually reinforcing.
- If a conversation is limited to whether you achieved the goal or not, you lose context.
    - You need **continuous performance management** to surface the critical questions:
        - _Was the goal harder to achieve than you'd thought when you set it?_
        - _Was it the right goal in the first place?_
        - _Is it motivating?_
        - _Should we double down oin the 2 or 3 things that really worked for us last quarter, or is it time to consider a pivot?_

### Reinventing HR

- Continuous performance management will lift every individual's achievement.
    - It elevates performance, bottom to top.
    - It works wonders for morale and personal development, for leaders and contributors.


| Annual Performance Management | Continuous Performance Management |
| - | -- |
| Annual feedback | Continuous feedback |
| Tied to compensation | Decoupled from compensation |
| Directing/autocratic | Coaching/democratic |
| Outcome focused | Process focused |
| Weakness based | Strength based |
| Prone to bias | Fact driven |

### An amicable divorce

- Divorce compensation from OKRs.
- These should be **2 dictinct conversations**, with their own cadences and calendar:
    - First: **backward-looking assessment**
        - held at yeald's end.
    - Second: ongoing, **forward-looking dialogue** between leaders and contributors:
        - _What are you working on?_
        - _How are you doing, how are your OKRs coming along?_
        - _Is there anything impeding your work?_
        - _What do you need from me to be more successful?_
        - _How do you need to grow to achieve your career goals?_
- OKRs reflect a person's most meaningful work
    - They're a source of reliable feedback for the cycle to come.
- But when goals are used and abused to set compensation, employees can be counted on to sandbag.
    - They start playing defense
    - They stop stretching for amazing.
    - They get bored for lack of challenge.
    - The organization suffers most of all.
- At Google, OKRs amount to a third or less of performance rating.


### Conversations

- The point of the 1:1 meeting:
    - Mutual teaching and exchange of information.
    - Should be regarded as **the subordinate's meeting** (agenda and tone).
    - The supervisor is there to learn and coach.
    - The supervisor should encourage the discussion of **heart-to-heart issues** (subtle and deep work-related problems).
- 5 critical areas emerge of these 1:1s:
    - **Goal setting and reflection**: where the employee;s OKR plan is set for the coming cycle.
    - **Ongoing process updates**: brief and data-driven checkins on the employee's real-time progress.
    - **Two-way coaching**: to help contributors reach their potential and managers do a better job.
    - **Career growth**: to develop skills, identify growth opportunities, and expand employees vision of their future at the company.
    - **Lightweight performance reviews**: feedback mechanism to gather inputs and summarize what the employees has accomplished since last meetings.

### Feedback

- Feedback is an **opinion**
    - grounded in observations and experiences
    - which allows us to know what impression we make on others.
- Feedback must be integral to the OKRs process.
    - If you don't know how well you are performing, how can you possibly get better?
- Feedback can be highly constructive, but **only if specific**.
- In mature organizations, feedback is **ad hoc**, **real-time**, and **multidirectional**.
    - It's an **open dialogu**e between people anywhere in the organization:
        - _What do you need from me to be successful?_
        - _And now let me tell you what I need from you._

### Recognition

- **Continuous recognition** is a powerful driver of engagement.
- How to implement it:
    - **Institute peer-to-peer recognition**
        - culture of gratitude
    - **Establish clear criteria**
        - recognize people for actions and results: completion of special projects, achievement of company goals, demonstrations of company values
        - Replace "Employee of the Month" with "Achievement of the Month"
    - **Share recognition stories**
        - ex: newsletter or company blogs
    - **Make recognition frequent and attainable**
        - hail smaller accomplishments, too (extra effort to meet a deadline, special polish on proposal, ... = the little things a manager might take for granted)
    - **Tie recognition to company goals and strategies**
        - customer service, innovation, teamwork, cost cutting, ... all can be suported by a shout-out
- Transparent OKRs make it natural for coworkers to celebrate big wins and smaller triumphs alike.

## 18. Culture

> You need a culture that high-fives small and innovative ideas. - Jeff Bezos

- Culture is **what makes meaning of work**.
- Goals cannot be attained in a vaccum. They require a medium.
    - For OKRs and CFRs, the medium is an organization's culture.
    - It's the living expression of its most cherished values and beliefs.
- **Healthy culture** and **structured goal setting** are interdependant.
    - They're natural partners in the quest for operating excellence.
- When a company is **culturally coherent**, the way forward is understood.
- An OKR culture is an **accountable culture**.
    - You don't push toward a goal just because the boss gave you an order.
    - You do it because every OKR is transparently important to the company, and to the colleagues who count on you.
    - Everybody takes pride in moving progress forward.
    - It's a self-governed social contract.
- High-motivation cultures rely on a mix of 2 elements:
    - **Catalysts**: actions that support work (~OKRs).
        - Setting clear goals
        - Allowing autonomy
        - Providing sufficient resources and time
        - Helping with the work
        - Openly learning frim problems and successes
        Allowing a free echange of ideas.
    - **Nourishers**: acts of interpersonal support (~CFRs).
        - Respect and recognition
        - Encouragement
        - Emotional comfort
        - Opportunities for affiliation
- Feedback is a **listening system**.
    - Leaders cannot wait for negative critiques on Glassdoor, or for values contributors to exit for another job.
    - They need to listen and capture signals as they are emitted.
