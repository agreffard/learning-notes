# Introduction

This book is about **leadership**. It serves as a useful guide to leaders who aspire to build, train, and lead high-performance winning teams.


Without a team (a group of individuals working to accomplish a mission) there is no leadership.


Every leader and every team at some point will fail and must confront that failure.


For leaders, the humility to **admit and own mistakes** and **develop a plan to overcome them** is essential to success.

The best leaders are not driven by ego or personal agendas. They are simply **focused on the mission** and how best to accomplish it.


# Part I. Winning the war within

## Chapter 1. Extreme Ownership

On any team, in any organization, all responsibility for success and failure rests with the leader. **The leader must own everything in his or her world**. There is no one else to blame.

The leader must:
- acknowledge mistakes and admit failures
- take ownership of them
- develop a plan to win

The best leaders don’t just take responsibility for their job. They take **Extreme Ownership** of everything that impacts their mission.

When subordinates aren’t doing what they should, leaders that exercise Extreme Ownership cannot blame the subordinates. They must first look in the mirror at themselves.

The leader bears **full responsibility** for:
- explaining the strategic mission
- developing the tactics
- securing the training and resources to enable the team to properly and successfully execute.

If an individual of the team is not performing at the level required for the team to succeed, the leader must **train and mentor** that underperformer. But if underperformers cannot improve, the leader must **be loyal to the team and the mission**, and make the tough call to terminate them and hire others who can get the job done.

Total responsibility for failure is a difficult thing to accept, and requires extraordinary **humility and courage**.

Extreme Ownership requires leaders to look at an organization's problems through the objective lens of reality, **without emotional attachments to agendas or plans**.


A leader must:
- set ego aside
- accept responsibility for failures
- attack weaknesses
- consistently work to build a better and more efficient team

Such a leader, however, does not take credit for his or her team's successes but bestows that honor upon his subordinate leaders and team members.

The direct responsibility of a leader includes getting people to listen, support, and execute plans.

You can’t *make* people listen yo you. You can’t *make* them execute. To implement real change, **you have to *lead* them**.

You must **remove individual ego and personal agenda**. It’s all about the mission.

## Chapter 2. No bad teams, only bad leaders

Leadership is the single greatest factor in any team’s performance.

Whether a team succeeds or fails is all up to the leader. **The leader's attitude sets the tone for the entire team**. The leader drives performance, or doesn’t. This applies not just to the most senior of an overall team, but to the junior leaders of teams within the teams.

A team could only deliver exceptional performance if a leader ensured the team worked together toward a focused goal and enforced high standards of performance, working together toward continuously improve. With a culture of Extreme Ownership within the team, every member of the team could contribute to this effort and ensure the highest levels of performance.

When it comes to standards, as a leader, *it’s not what you preach, it’s what you tolerate*. When setting expectations, no matter what has been said or written, **if substandard performance is accepted and no one is held accountable, that poor performance becomes the new standard**.

Leaders must **enforce standards**. They must ensure that tasks are repeated until the higher expected standard is achieved.

The leader must pull the different elements within the team together to support one another, with all focused exclusively on how to best accomplish the mission.

Every team must have junior leaders **ready to step up** and temporarily take on the roles and responsibilities of their immediate bosses to carry on the team’s mission and get the job done if and when the need arises.

Leaders should never be satisfied. They must always strive to improve, and they must build that mindset into the team. They must face the facts through a realistic, brutally honest assessment of themselves and their team’s performance. Identifying weaknesses, good leaders seek to strengthen them and come up with a plan to overcome challenges.

The best teams are **constantly looking to improve**, **add capacity**, and **push the standards higher**.

A *Tortured Genius* accepts zero responsibility for mistakes, makes excuses, and blames everyone else for their failings (and those of their team). In their mind, the rest of the world just can’t see or appreciate the genius in what they are doing. They can have catastrophic impact on a team’s performance.

## Chapter 3. Believe

In order to convince and inspire others to follow and accomplish a mission, a leader must be a** true believer in the mission**.

Leaders must always operate with the understanding that they are **part of something greater than themselves** and their own personal interests. They must impart this understanding to their team down to the tactical-level operators on the ground.

Once a leader believes in the mission, that belief shines through to those below and above in the chain of command. Actions and words reflect belief with a **clear confidence** and **self-assuredness** that is not possible when belief is in doubt.

When a leader’s confidence breaks, those who are supposed to follow him or her see this and begin to question their own belief in the mission.

Every leader must be able to detach from the immediate tactical mission and **understand how it fits into strategical goals**. When leaders receive an order that they themselves question and do not understand, they must ask the question: **Why?** Why are we being asked to do this?

Those leaders must:
- take a step back
- deconstruct the situation
- analyze the strategic picture
- and then come to a conclusion.

If they cannot determine a satisfactory answer themselves, **they must ask questions up the chain of command** until they understand why.

It is incumbent on senior leaders to **take the time to explain and answer the questions** of their junior leaders so that they too can understand why and believe.

Goals must always be in alignment.

Junior leaders must **ask questions** and also **provide feedback up the chain** so that senior leaders can fully understand the ramifications of how strategic plans affect execution on the ground.

Leadership isn't one person leading a team. It is **a group of leaders working together**, up and down the chain of command, to lead. If you are on your own, I don’t care how good you are, you won’t be able to handle it.

If you don’t ask questions so you can understand and believe in the mission, you are failing as a leader and you are failing your team.

**Ask questions until you understand why** so you can believe in what you are doing and you can pass that information down the chain to your team with confidence, so they can get out and execute the mission.

## Chapter 4. Check the ego

Ego clouds and disrupts everything: the planning process, the ability to take good advice, and the ability to accept constructive criticism.

Often, **the most difficult ego to deal with is *your own***.

Many of the disruptive issues that arise within a team can be attributed directly to a problem with ego.

Implementing Extreme Ownership requires **checking your ego** and operating with a **high degree of humility**. Admitting mistakes, taking ownership, and developing a plan to overcome challenges are integral to any successful team. Ego can prevent a leader from conducting a honest, realistic assessment of his or her own performance and the performance of the team.

Taking Extreme Ownership is counterintuitive. It’s natural for everyone in a leadership position to blame subordinate leaders and direct reports when something goes wrong. Our ego don’t like to take blame. But it’s on us leaders to see where we failed to communicate effectively and help our troops clearly understand what their roles and responsibilities are and how their actions impact the bigger strategic picture.

**It’s not about you**. It’s about the mission and how best to accomplish it.

# Part II. The laws of combat

## Chapter 5. Cover and move

Cover and move means **teamwork**.

All elements within the greater team are crucial and must work together to accomplish the mission, **mutually supporting one another**. Departments and groups within the team must break down silos, depend on each other and understand who depends on them.

It falls on leaders to continually keep perspective on the strategic mission and telling the team that **they are part of the greater team** and the strategic mission is paramount.

If the overall team fails, everyone fails.

When the team succeeds, everyone within and supporting the team succeeds.

## Chapter 6. Simple

**Simplifying as much as possible** is crucial to success.

When plans and orders are too complicated, people may not understand them.

Plans ans orders must be communicated in a manner that is **simple, clear, and concise**. Everyone that is part of the mission must know and understand his or her role in the mission and what to do in the event of likely contingencies.

As a leader, it doesn’t matter how well you feel you have presented the information or communicated an order, plan, tactic, or strategy. **If your team doesn’t get it, you have not kept things simple and you have failed**. You must brief to ensure the lowest common denominator on the team understands.

Almost no mission ever goes according to plan. If the plan is simple enough, everyone understands it, which means each person can rapidly adjust and modify what he or she is doing. If the plan is too complex, the team can’t make rapid adjustments to it, because there is no baseline understanding of it.

## Chapter 7. Prioritize and execute

Prioritize and execute = *“Relax, look around, make a call”*.

Even the most competent of leaders can be overwhelmed if they try to tackle multiple problems or a number of tasks simultaneously. The team will likely fail at each of those tasks. Instead, leaders must **determine the highest priority task** and execute.

Stay at least **a step or two ahead of real-time problems**. Through careful contingency planning, a leader can anticipate likely challenges that could arise during execution and map out an effective response to those challenges before they happen. If the team has been briefed and understands what actions to take through such likely contingencies, the team can then rapidly execute when those problems arise, even without specific direction from leaders.

To implement Prioritize and Execute, a leader must:
- evaluate the highest priority problem
- lay out in simple, clear, and concise terms the highest priority effort for your team
- develop and determine a solution, seek input from key leaders and from the team where possible
- direct the execution of that solution, focusing all efforts and resources toward this priority task
- move on to the next highest priority problem. Repeat.
- when priorities shift within the team, pass situational awareness both up and down the chain
- don’t let the focus on one priority cause target fixation. Maintain the ability to see other problems developing and rapidly shift as needed


## Chapter 8. Decentralized command

Human beings are generally not capable of managing more than **six to ten people**, particularly when things go sideways and inevitable contingencies arise.

Teams must be broken down into **manageable elements of four to five operators**, with a clearly designated leader. Those leaders must understand the overall mission, and the ultimate goal of that mission: **the Commander’s intent**.

Junior leaders must be **empowered to make decisions on key tasks** necessary to accomplish that mission in the most effective and efficient manner possible. They must fully understand what is within their decision-making authority (the "left and right limits") of their responsibility. They must be **proactive** rather than reactive.

It is imperative that frontline leaders **execute with confidence**. They must have implicit trust that their senior leaders will back their decisions.

Senior leaders must constantly **communicate and push information** (situational awareness) to their subordinate leaders. Likewise, junior leaders must **push situational awareness up the chain** to their senior leaders to keep them informed, particularly of crucial information that affects strategic decision making.

Leaders must be free to move to where they are most needed, which changes throughout the course of an operation.

As a leader, it takes strength to let go. It takes faith and trust in subordinate, frontline leaders and their abilities.

It requires trust up and down the chain of command:
- trust that subordinates will do the right thing
- trust that superiors will support subordinates if they are acting in accordance with the mission statement and Commander’s intent.

Trust is not blindly given. It must be built over times.

Why build trust:
- open conversations
- overcoming stress and challenging environments
- working through emergencies and seeing how people react

Situations will sometimes require that the boss walk away from a problem and let junior leaders solve it, even if the boss knows he might solve it more efficiently. It is more important that the junior leaders are allowed to make decisions, and backed up even if they don’t make them correctly.

Junior leaders must know that **their boss will back them up** even if they make a decision that lay not result in the best outcome, as long as the decision was made in an effort to achieve the strategic objective.

# Part III. Sustaining victory

## Chapter 9. Plan

Leaders must **identify clear directives for the team**.

**The mission must explain the overall purpose and desired result** ("end state") of the operation.

The frontline troops tasked with executing the mission must understand the deeper purpose behind the mission.

Once the course of action is determined, further planning requires detailed information gathering in order to facilitate the development of a thorough plan. It is critical to utilize all the assets and lean on the expertise of those in the best position to provide the most accurate and up-to-date information.

Leaders must **delegate the planning process down the chain** as much as possible to key subordinate leaders. Team participation (even from the most junior personnel) is critical in developing bold, innovative solutions to problem sets. Giving the frontline troops **ownership of even a small piece of the plan** gives them buy-in, helping them understand the reading behind the plan, and better enables them to believe in the mission, which translates to far more effective implementation and execution on the ground.

While the senior leader supervises the entire planning process by team members, he or she must be **careful not to get bogged down in the details**.

Once the detailed plan has been developed, it must then be **briefed to the entire team** and all participants and supporting elements.

The planning process and briefing must be a forum that **encourages discussion, questions, and clarification** from even the most junior personnel.

Leaders must **ask questions of their troops**, **encourage interaction**, and **ensure their teams understand the plan**.

The plan must **mitigate identified risks** where possible.

The best teams employ constant analysis of their tactics and **measure their effectiveness** so that they can adapt their methods and implement lessons learned for future missions.

A **post-operational debrief** examines all phases of an operation from planning through execution, in concise format. It adresses the following for the mission completed:
- what went right?
- what went wrong?
- how can we adapt our tactics to make us even more effective and increase our advantage over the enemy?

The planning process should be **standardized within the company** so that other departments and supporting assets outside the company can understand and use the same format and terminology.

A leader’s checklist for planning should include the following:
- Analyze the mission
    - Understand higher headquarters’s mission, Commander’s Intent, and endstate (the goal)
    - Identify and state your own Commander’s Intent and endstate for the specific mission
- Identify personnel, assets, resources, and time available
- Decentralize the planning process
    - Empower key leaders within the team to analyze possible courses of action
- Determine a specific course of action
    - Lean toward selecting the simplest course of action
    - Focus efforts on the best course of action
- Empower key leaders to develop the plan for the selected course of action
- Plan for likely contingencies through each phase of the operation
- Mitigate risks that can be controlled as much as possible
- Delegate portions of the plan and brief to key junior leaders
    - Stand back and be the tactical genius
- Continually check and question the plan against emerging information to ensure it still fits the situation
- Brief the plan to all participants and supporting assets
    - Emphasize Commander’s Intent
    - Ask questions and engage in discussion and interaction with the team to ensure they understand
- Conduct post-operational debrief after execution
    - Analyze lessons learned and implement them in future planning

## Chapter 10. Leading up and down the chain of command

### Leading down the chain

Senior leaders must explain to their junior leaders and troops executing the mission how their role contributes to big picture success.

Leaders must routinely communicate with their team members to help them understand their role in the overall mission.

Frontline leaders and troops can then connect the dots between what they do every day and how that impacts the company’s strategic goals.

Leading down requires regularly **stepping out of the office** and personally **engaging in face-to-face conversations** with direct reports and observing the frontline troops in action to understand their particular challenges and read them into the Commander’s intent. This enables the team to understand why they are doing what they are doing.

### Leading up the chain

Leading up the chain of command requires tactful engagement with the immediate boss to obtain the decisions and support necessary to enable your team to accomplish its mission. To do this, a leader must **push situational awareness up the chain of command**. The subordinate leader must use influence, experience, knowledge, communication, and maintain the highest professionalism.

You must also realize that your boss must allocate limited assets and make decisions with the bigger picture in mind. **Have the humility to understand and accept this**.

One of the most important jobs of any leader is to support your own boss. The leadership must always present a united front to the troops. A public display of discontent or disagreement with the chain of command undermines the authority of leaders at all levels.

If you don’t understand why decisions are being made, requests denied, or support allocated elsewhere, you must **ask those questions up the chain**.

Leaders will not always agree. But once the debate is over and the boss has made a decision (even if that decision is one you argued against), **you must execute the plan *as if it were your own***.

When leading up the chain, **use caution and respect**. But remember, if your leader is not giving the support you need, **don’t blame him or her**. Instead, **reexamine what you can do** to better clarify, educate, influence, or convince that person to give you what you need in order to win.

Major factors to be aware of:
- **take responsibility for leading everyone in your world**, subordinates and superiors alike
- if someone isn’t doing what you want or need them to do, **look in the mirror first** and determine what you can do to better enable this
- don’t ask your leader what you should do, **tell them what you are going to do**.

The senior leadership wants you to succeed. It’s up to you to inform them and help them understand some of the challenges you are dealing with here on the ground.

## Chapter 11. Decisiveness and uncertainty

Leaders cannot be paralyzed by fear. That results in inaction.

It is critical for leaders to **act decisively amid uncertainty**; to make the best decisions they can based on only the immediate information available.

There is no 100% right solution. The picture is never complete. Leaders must be confortable with this and be able to **make decisions promptly**, then be ready to **adjust those decisions quickly** based on evolving situations and new information.

Waiting for the 100% right and certain solution leads to delay, indecision, and inability to execute. Leaders must be prepared to **make an educated guess** based on previous experience, knowledge of how the enemy operates, likely outcomes, and whatever intelligence is available in the immediate moment.

As a leader, **you need to be seen as decisive**, and **willing to make tough choices**. The outcome may be uncertain, but you have enough understanding and information to make a decision.

## Chapter 12. Discipline equals freedom

### The dichotomy of leadership

A good leader must be:

- confident but not cocky
- courageous but not foolhardy
- competitive but a gracious loser
- attentive to details but not obsessed by them
- strong but have endurance
- humble but not passive
- aggressive but not overbearing
- quiet but not silent
- calm but not robotic
- logical but not devoid of emotions
- close with the troops but not so close that one becomes more important than another or more important than the mission, not so close that they forget who is in charge
- able to execute Extreme Ownership, while exercising Decentralized Command


***A good leader has nothing to prove, but everything to prove***.
