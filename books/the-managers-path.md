## What to expect from a manager

### One-on-one meetings
1-1 meetings serve two purposes:
1. Create **human connection** between you and your manager.
    - Letting your manager into your life a little bit is important, because when there are stressful things happening, it will be much easier to tell him what your need if he has context of you as a person.
    - Great managers notice when your normal energy level changes, and will helpfully care enough to ask you about it.
    - The bedrock of strong teams is **human connection**, which leads to **trust**. And trust requires the ability and willingness to be vulnerable in front of each other.
2. Regular opportunity to speak privately about whatever needs discussing.
    - You should expect 1-1s to be scheduled with some predictability, so that you can plan for them.
    - It‚Äôs **not** a status meeting (they are boring and repetitive).

### Feedback and workspace guidance
- Ideally, feedback is:
    - Public if it‚Äôs praise
    - Private if it‚Äôs criticism.
- Your manager is the **number one ally** when it comes to your role at the company.

### Training and career growth
- Your manager should help you **find training** and other resources for career growth. (conference, class, book,etc)
- Your manager will contribute to your career growth via **promotion** and **compensation**.

## How to be managed

### Spend time thinking about what you want

- The onus of figuring out what you want to do, what you want to learn, and what will make you happy rests on _your_ shoulders.

### You are responsible for yourself

- **Knowing yourself** is step one.
- Step two is **going after what you want**:
    - Bring agendas to your 1-1s.
    - When you want to work on a project, ask.
    - When your manager is not helpful, look for other places to get help.
    - Seek out feedback (including areas to improve).
    - When you are persistently unhappy, speak out.
    - When you are stuck, ask for help.
    - When you want a raise, ask for it.
    - When you want a promotion, find out what you need to do to get it.
- You will not get everything you want, and asking is not fun. However, it's the fastest way forward.


### Give your manager a break

- Your manager **will be imperfect**.
    - Her job  is to do the best thing for the company and the team.
    - It is _not_ to do whatever it takes to make you happy all the time.
- The only person you can change is yourself.
    - You should provide feedback to your manager, but understand that she may not listen or change.
    - Your manager expect you to bring solutions, not problems.

### Choose your manager wisely

- Consider not only the job, the company and the pay, but also the manager when evaluating job opportunities.
- Strong managers:
    - know how to play the game at the company
    - can get your promoted
    - can get you attention and feedback from important people
    - have strong networks. They can get you jobs even after you stop working for them.

## Mentoring (p11)
TODO

###  ‚Äúalpha geek‚Äù


## Tech lead (p32)

### Tech lead main roles
- **System architect and business analyst**:
    - Identify critical systems that need to change
    - Identify critical features that need to be built
    - Provide structure for basing estimates and ordering work
    - Understand business requirements and translate them into software

- **Project planner**:
    - Break work down into rough deliverables
    - Identify priorities
    - Gather inputs from the experts on the team

- **Software developer and team leader**:
    - Continue writing code, but not too much
    - Delegate
    - Communicate obstacles

‚ö†Ô∏èTeams often fail because they overworked themselves on a feature that their product manager would have been willing to compromise on

### Managing a project

1. Break complex end goal into smaller pieces
2. Put those pieces in the most effective order they should be done
3. Identify those pieces in the most effective order they should be done
4. Identify which pieces can be done in parallel or in sequence
5. Attempt to tease out the unknowns of the project. That may cause it to slow down or fail

Your main objectives:
- Addressing uncertainty
- Trying to find the unknowns
- Recognizing that you are going to make mistakes and miss some unknowns

## How to be a great tech lead?

- **Understand the architecture**.
    - Take time to learn it. Get a sense, visualize it.
    - Understand its connections, where the data lives, how it flows between systems. understand how it reflects the product it is supporting, where the code logic for those product lives.

- **Be a team player**.
    - If you are doing all the interesting work yourself, stop.
    - If you‚Äôre only doing the most boring stuff, stop.
    - Working on the less exciting parts of the code base can teach you a lot about where the process is broken.

- **Lead technical decisions**.
    - Determine which decisions must be made by you, which decisions should be delegated to other with more expertise, and which decisions require the whole team to resolve.
        - if alone = they will resent you and blame you when things go wrong
        - if all up to the team = risk of drag on without resolution

- **Communicate**.
    - Your productivity is now less important than the productivity of the whole team.
    - Successful leaders:
        - write well
        - read carefully
        - can get up in front of a group and speak
        - pay attention in meetings
        - are constantly testing the limits of their knowledge (and of their team)
    - Listen!
        - Hear what people say.
        - Practice repeating back to people to ensure you understand them.
        - Learn to hear, and rephrase with your own words.
        - Be a note taker.

## Managing people (p50)

### How to start a new reporting relationship.

- **Build trust and rapport**.
    - How do you like to be praised? (in public or private?)
    - What‚Äôs your preferred method of communication for feedback? (written or verbal?)
    - Why did you decide to work here? What are you excited about?
    - How do I know when you‚Äôre in a bad mood or annoyed?
    - Any manager behaviors that you know you hate?
    - Do you have any clear career goals?
    - Any surprises since you‚Äôve joined? (good or bad)\

    => see Lara Hogan‚Äôs blog: [Questions for our first 1:1](https://larahogan.me/blog/first-one-on-one-questions/)

- **Create a 30/60/90 day plan**.
    - TODO

- **Communicate your style and expectations**.
    - How often you want to meet
    - How you two share information
    - When/how you review the work (ex: weekly summary of progress by email?)
    - How long you work alone trying to solve a problem

- **Get feedback**.
    - First 90 days = fresh eyes
    - TODO

### 1-1: different 1-1 styles

-  **The to-do list meetings**.
    - One or both parties comes with a list of objectives to cover.
    - Follows ‚Äúdon‚Äôt waste time with pointless meetings‚Äù

    üëçVery professional and efficient\
    üëéA bit cold

- **The catch-up**.
    - The meeting is driven by the report. Whatever they feel is important

    üëçCreative discussion and planning meeting\
    üëéCan become a complaining session or therapy


- **The feedback meeting**.
    - Quarterly
    - If thinking of firing = document these feedback meetings (issues discussed and expectations).
    - If need of immediate corrective feedback (ex: insult) don‚Äôt wait for the 1-1 (same for praise).

- **The progress report**.
    - If managing individuals = only for side projects

- **Getting to know you**.
    - Get to know the person as a human being
    - Let them talk about family, friends, hobbies, pets
    - Get to know their career so far
    - Ask about long term career goals

- **Mix it up!**
    - Do walking meetings, or over coffee or lunch
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è If not taking notes = risk of forgetting
    - Do the 1-1 in private
    - Keep notes in a shared document. Keep context about when and what was said. Useful for writing review and delivering feedback.

### Delegating
A good leader is good at delegating.

- **Use team‚Äôs goals to understand which details to dig into.**
    - Ask them to make successes visible to you
    - Only if they have nothing to share, dig into more details
    - If they don‚Äôt have a clear plan, help them create one.
    - What are you holding them accountable against this month, this quarter, this year?

- **Gather information from systems before going to the people**.
    - Commits, tickets, etc.

- **Adjust focus depending on the stage of the projects**.
    - Beginning = more involved (facilitate good set of goals or system design)
    - Close to delivery date = more details (more decisions to be made, with more actionable actions)
    - Normal workflow = enough to know what is moving forward and what is taking longer

- **Establish standards for code and systems**
    - Develop guidelines and standards (ex: how much UT? Code reviews? Etc)

- **Treat open sharing of info (good or bad) in a neutral way**.
    - ex: do not punish mistakes with micromanagement

### Creating a culture of continuous feedback  (p61)
1. **Know your people**.
    - What are their goals?
    - Their strengths/weaknesses?
    - At what level are they operating?
    - What is needed to get to the next level?
2. **Observe your people**.
    - Look for talents and achievements in the teams
    - Look for weaknesses and areas of improvements, too
    - Identify people who deserve praise
    - Every week, try to have at least one thing you can recognize about someone on your team.
    - Ideally, have one weekly think for **everyone** of the team

3. **Provide lightweight, regular feedback**.
    - Start with positive feedback. It makes people more likely to listen to critical feedback.

4. (Bonus) **Provide coaching**.
    - Ask what they might have done differently
    - Make suggestions
    - Form a partnership


### Performance reviews

- **360 model**: includes feedback from:
    - Manager
    - Teammates
    - Anyone who reports to him
    - Coworkers he interacts with
    - Self-review

    The manager gathers all feedback and summarizes.

    ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks:
    -  We tend to remember / overemphasize recent things only
    - Various biases (ex: risk of criticizing people for behaviors that we don‚Äôt notice in others)


- **Give yourself time, and start early**.
    - Plan to spend solid, uninterrupted time working on reviews.
    - Work from home if needed.

- **Try to account for the whole year, not just the past couple of months**.
    - Keep notes of what happened with each person throughout the year.
    - Keep a running summary of 1-1s, including feedback

- **Use concrete examples and excerpts form peer reviews**.
    - Be specific to avoid underlying bias.
    - If possible, anonymize the peer reviews.

- **Spend plenty of time on accomplishments and strengths**.
    - Celebrate achievements
    - Talk about what‚Äôs going well
    - Praise good work
    - Don‚Äôt let people skip over good stuff (it‚Äôs very common)
    - These strengths will be used to determine when people should be promoted. Reflect on them.

- **When it comes to areas of improvements, keep it focused**.
    - Exemples of common themes:
        - Struggle with saying no to distractions
        - Do good work but is overly critical to others, is rude, etc
        - Struggle to break work into intermediate deliverables
        - Do not work well with other departments
        - Struggle to follow the accepted best practices of the team
        - Use your judgement.
            - ex: if only one person mentions ¬´ sloppy work ¬ª: is it true? Or maybe the reviewer had higher standards than the rest of the team?

    - If no feedback for improvement : indicate 1 or 2 skills they need to expand to become qualified for promotion

- **Avoid big surprises**.
    - If underperforming: the review should _not_ be the first time getting that feedback.
    - If recently promoted : prepare them for higher standards and expectations .

- **Schedule enough time to discuss the review**.
    - Give people a printed copy of the review the evening before
    - Still take time to go over each section (do not skip strengths and accomplishments)

## How to identify potential?
- Real potential shows itself quickly:
    - Work hard to go the extra mile
    - Offer insightful suggestions on problems
    - Help the team in areas previously neglected
- Potential must be tied to **actions** and **value produced**, even if it‚Äôs not the value you expected to see produced.

### Cultivating careers
The manager plays a key role in getting people promoted.

- Your job is to:
    - Make sure they are learning how to estimate their own work
    - Get it done roughly within the estimates
    - Learn from their mistakes

- Evidence for promotion :
    - Projects or features completed independently
    - Participation in on-call rotations
    - Engagement in team meetings / team planning

- Learn how the game is played at your company. Ask your manager:
    - How are the decisions made?
    - How early do you need to start preparing packets?
    - Are there limits on the number of promotions per year?

- Be transparent with the team.
    - Identify promotion-worthy projects.
    - Give them to people close to promotion.
    - Encourage people to volunteer.

### Firing underperformers
- Wite a person a **performance improvement plan**.
    - Set of clearly defined objectives that the person post achieve within a fixed period of time.
- The process should begin long before!
    - Rule of no surprises.
    - Start giving feedback early and often, and keep records.

‚ö†Ô∏èIf you avoid tackling negative feedback until it builds to a building point m, you‚Äôre going to be met with a pile of excuses.

## Managing a team (p75)
- The Engineering lead is an **independant manager**.  
Roles:
    - Manage team members with different skill sets from their own
    - Communicate expectations clearly
    - Solicit and deliver individual feedback frequently
    - Leader for the technical roadmap:
        - communicate the timeline, scope and risks
    - Identify areas of strategic technical debt:
        - do cost/benefit analysis for resolving the debt
        - communicate suggested timelines for this.

### **Staying technical**.
- Engineering management is a **technical discipline**, not just a set of people skills.
- Your job will require that you guide technical decision making.
    - **Technical instincts** honed over years of doing the job are very important for guiding this process.
- If you truly wish to command the respect of an engineering team, they must see you as **technically credible**.


### Debugging dysfunctional teams
- **Not shipping**
    - Learn how to balance pushing your team and holding back.
    - Start to push for the removal of processes bottlenecks:
        - poor tooling around releases
        - heavily manual testing
        - features too big
        - developers who don‚Äôt know how to break their work down
        - etc


- **People drama**
    - The **"brillant asshole"**:
        - he is productive and smart, but isn‚Äôt a team player and makes everyone around him unhappy.
        - Be prepared to have a series of conversations with both the employee and your boss.
    - The **negative person** (= "energy vampires"):
        - Sometimes he is just unhappy and the best thing to do is to help him leave the team on good terms.
        - Be careful that vocally negative people don‚Äôt stay in that mindset on your team for long.
        - Quick action is essential.

- **Unhappiness due to work**
    - If overwork is due to (in)stability of the production system:
        - **slow down the product roadmap** in order to focus on stability for a while.
        - make **clear measure** of alerts, downtime, and incidents, and strive to reduce them.
    - If overwork is due to a pressing, time-critical release: you should be a **cheerleader**. Support the team however they need supporting:
        - Order dinner.
        - Thell them you appreciate the hard work.
        - Make it clear they‚Äôll have explicit break time after the push.
        - Make it as fun as you can in the moment.

- **Collaboration problems**
    - Make sure you‚Äôre having regular touch-bases (product team, design team, or another tech team) to work through issues:
        - Gather actionable feedback from your team.
        - Have productive conversations about possible improvements.
        - Try to stay positive and supportive of the other teams efforts in public.
    - Look into creating some opportunities for the team to hang out without it being all about work:
        - Taking the whole team to lunch
        - Leaving work early on a Friday afternoon to attend a fun event together
        - Encouraging some PG-rated humor in chat rooms
        - Asking people how their lives are going

### **The shield**

It‚Äôs valuable for everyone to realize that they can and should focus on the things they can impact and change, and ignore the things they can‚Äôt.

- Yes, shielding your team from distractions is important:
    - help them understand the key important goals
    - focus them on these goals
- But it‚Äôs unrealistic to expect that you can or should shield your team from everything.
    - Sometimes it‚Äôs appropriate to let some of the stress through the team.
        - The goal is not to stress them out, but to help them get context into what they are dealing with.
        - Appropriate context is what helps teams make good decisions about how and where to focus their energy.
        - It‚Äôs not your job to make all of those decisions by yourself.
    - Another error that the shield sometimes makes is denying that any drama exists in the outside world.
        - If layoffs happen in another part of the company and the team finds out from someone else, you‚Äôve created a situation where they feel like something bad is happening and no one wants to admit it.
        - If you instead communicate information about such events in a straightforward, low-emotion way, you alleviate the gossip and quickly neutralize the impact on your team.
    - You are _not_ a parent.
        - Sometimes, in combining the roles of shield and mentor we end up in a parenting-style relationship with our team, and treat them more fragile children to be protected, nurtured, and chided as appropriate.
        - Your team is made up of adults who need to be treated with appropriate respect.

### How to drive good decisions
While the product manager is responsible for the product roadmap, and the tech lead is responsible for the technical details, you are accountable for the **teams progress** through each of these elements.

While you may only have the authority to guide decisions rather than dictate them, you‚Äôll still be judged by how well those decisions turn out.

- **Create a data-driven team culture**
    -  Start tracking data about:
        - team productivity (ex: time it takes to complete features)
        - quality mesures (ex: how much time is spent dealing with outages, or number of bugs found in QA)
    - These efficiency and technical data points can be used to evaluate decisions on both product features and technical changes.

- **Flex your product muscles**
    - You have some group that depends on the output of your work.
    - Threat them as your customer.
    - Take time to develop customer empathy.
    - It will help you give context to the team and invest engineering effort.

- **Look into the future**
    - You need to think two steps ahead, from a product and technology perspective.
    - Getting a sense of where the product roadmap is going helps you guide the technical roadmap.
    - Start asking the product team questions about what the future might look like.
    - Spend some time keeping up with technological developments.

- **Review the outcome of your decisions and projects**
    - Was it true that the team moved faster after you rewrote that system?
    - Did customer behavior change in the way the product team predicted?
    - What have you learned from your A/B tests?

- **Run retrospectives for the processes and day-to-day**
    - Is the team feeling good about how they get requirements?
    - Do they feel good about the code quality?
    - This process helps you learn how the decisions you make over time affect the way your team operates in the day-to-day.
    - This is more subjective than gathering data about the team‚Äôs health, but more valuable than many objective measures.

### Managing conflict 
Conflict-avoidant managers tend to favor harmony above functional working relationships. Creating a safe environment for disagreement to work itself out is far better than pretending that all disagreement does not exist.

- **The dos and don‚Äôts of managing conflict**
    - Don‚Äôt rely exclusively on consensus or voting
    - Do set up clear processes to depersonalize decisions. The group needs to have a clear set of standards that they use to evaluate decisions. Share understanding of the goals, risks and questions to answer before making a decision.
    - Don‚Äôt turn a blind eye to simmering issues. Conflict avoidance manifests in an inability to address problems until they‚Äôve gone on for way too long.
    - Do address issues without courting drama. The goal is to identify problems and resolve them, no to become the team's therapist.
    - Don‚Äôt take it out on other teams.
    - Remember to be kind. Your goal is not to be nice, it is to be kind.
    - Don‚Äôt be afraid. Conflict avoidance often arises from fear.
    - Get curious.

- **Team cohesion destroyers**
    - Build teams that work well and happily together:
        - The real goal is **psychological safety**.
        - Build a team whose members are willing to take risks and make mistakes in front of one another. This is the underpinning of a successful team.
        - Take time to get to know people as human beings:
            - Ask them about their extracurricular lives and interests.
            - This more than empty small talks. It fosters relatedness, the sense of people as individuals and not just anonymous cogs.
        - Teams that are friendly are happier, gem faster, and tend to produce better results.
        - This is why those who underline team cohesion are so problematic.
        - They make is hard for the rest of the team to feel safe around them.

    - **The brilliant jerk**
        - Produces individual outsized results, but is ego-driven.
        - Creates a mixture of fear and dislike in everyone around them.
        - If they don‚Äôt see the behavior as a problem, they won‚Äôt change it.
        - You alone won‚Äôt be able to convince them that their behavior is a problem.
        - If possible, do not hire one. And do not promote them.
        - Openly refuse to tolerate bad behavior.
        - Have a have tight control of your own reaction because delivering this in public is walking a fine line.
        - If you seem emotional, it may undermine you.
        - Your first goal is to protect your team as a whole, the second is to protect each individual on the team, and your last priority is protecting yourself.

    - **The non communicator**
        - The person who hides information from you, from your teammates or from his product manager.
        - You have to nip this information-hiding in the bud as soon as possible.
        - If necessary, make it clear he‚Äôs not meeting expectations for his work.
        - This person disrupts team cohesion because he isn‚Äôt being collaborative with the rest of his teammates.
        - Address the root cause of the hiding.
            - Is the hider afraid of being criticized?
            - Does your team have a harsh culture?
            - Does your team have that psychological safety in general?
            - Is the rest of the team treating this person as an outsider?

    - **The employee who lacks respect**
        - This person doesn‚Äôt respect you as a manager or doesn‚Äôt respect her teammates.
        - Addressing this person may require some help from your manager.
        - If you can handle this yourself, it‚Äôs a sign of great character.
        - Ask her if she wants to be working on your team.
        - Lay out what you expect, clearly and calmly.
        - You can‚Äôt have a person working for you who doesn‚Äôt respect you, or doesn‚Äôt respect your team.

### Advanced project management
Project management rules of thumb:

- **None of this is a replacement for agile project management**
    - Most teams have both high level, long term goals, and short term objectives that will enable them to meet those goals.
    - You are responsible for the larger picture. The accomplishments that are measured in months instead of weeks.

- **You have 10 productive engineering weeks per engineer per quarter.**
    - Don‚Äôt expect to get more than 10 weeks worth of focused efforts on the main projects per team member per quarter.
    - Q1 will be the most productive and S4 will be the least productive.

- **Budget 20% of your time for generic sustaining engineering work across the board**
    - Testing, debugging, cleaning up legacy code, migrating language or platform version, etc.
    - Make it a habit. Use it to tackle some of the midsize legacy code every quarter and get decent improvements.

- **As you  approach deadlines, it is your job to say no**
    - If necessary, cut scope at the end of the project.
    - Figure out what "must-haves" are not actually must-haves.

- **Use the doubling rule for quick estimates, but push for planning time to estimate longer tasks.**
    - Whenever asked for an estimate, take your guess and double it.
    - If needed, make it clear that you‚Äôll need some planning time before you‚Äôre sure about the timescale.

- **Be selective about what you bring to the team to estimate**
    - It‚Äôs distracting and stressful for engineers to have a manager who‚Äôs constantly asking them for random project estimates.
    - You‚Äôre responsible for handling uncertainty and limiting how much of that uncertainty you expose to the team.

### First weeks joining a small team as a manager:
- If there‚Äôs a developer onboarding process, go through that process.
- Start watching the code reviews or pull requests.
- Plan to work on at least a couple of features in your first 60 days.
- Pair with one of the engineers.
- Get your code reviewed.
- Perform a release.
- By getting to know the code, the processes for writing code, and the tools and systems your team use for their day-to-day, you will gain the understanding necessary for managing the team, and the technical credibility necessary for then to see you as a capable leader.
