## What to expect from a manager

### One-on-one meetings
1-1 meetings serve two purposes:
1. Create **human connection** between you and your manager.
    - Letting your manager into your life a little bit is important, because when there are stressful things happening, it will be much easier to tell him what your need if he has context of you as a person.
    - Great managers notice when your normal energy level changes, and will helpfully care enough to ask you about it.
    - The bedrock of strong teams is **human connection**, which leads to **trust**. And trust requires the ability and willingness to be vulnerable in front of each other.
2. Regular opportunity to speak privately about whatever needs discussing.
    - You should expect 1-1s to be scheduled with some predictability, so that you can plan for them.
    - It‚Äôs **not** a status meeting (they are boring and repetitive).

### Feedback and workspace guidance
- Ideally, feedback is:
    - Public if it‚Äôs praise
    - Private if it‚Äôs criticism.
- Your manager is the **number one ally** when it comes to your role at the company.

### Training and career growth
- Your manager should help you **find training** and other resources for career growth. (conference, class, book,etc)
- Your manager will contribute to your career growth via **promotion** and **compensation**.

## How to be managed

### Spend time thinking about what you want

- The onus of figuring out what you want to do, what you want to learn, and what will make you happy rests on _your_ shoulders.

### You are responsible for yourself

- **Knowing yourself** is step one.
- Step two is **going after what you want**:
    - Bring agendas to your 1-1s.
    - When you want to work on a project, ask.
    - When your manager is not helpful, look for other places to get help.
    - Seek out feedback (including areas to improve).
    - When you are persistently unhappy, speak out.
    - When you are stuck, ask for help.
    - When you want a raise, ask for it.
    - When you want a promotion, find out what you need to do to get it.
- You will not get everything you want, and asking is not fun. However, it's the fastest way forward.


### Give your manager a break

- Your manager **will be imperfect**.
    - Her job  is to do the best thing for the company and the team.
    - It is _not_ to do whatever it takes to make you happy all the time.
- The only person you can change is yourself.
    - You should provide feedback to your manager, but understand that she may not listen or change.
    - Your manager expect you to bring solutions, not problems.

### Choose your manager wisely

- Consider not only the job, the company and the pay, but also the manager when evaluating job opportunities.
- Strong managers:
    - know how to play the game at the company
    - can get your promoted
    - can get you attention and feedback from important people
    - have strong networks. They can get you jobs even after you stop working for them.

## Mentoring (p11)

###  ‚Äúalpha geek‚Äù


## Tech lead (p32)

### Tech lead main roles
- **System architect and business analyst**:
    - Identify critical systems that need to change
    - Identify critical features that need to be built
    - Provide structure for basing estimates and ordering work
    - Understand business requirements and translate them into software

- **Project planner**:
    - Break work down into rough deliverables
    - Identify priorities
    - Gather inputs from the experts on the team

- **Software developer and team leader**:
    - Continue writing code, but not too much
    - Delegate
    - Communicate obstacles

‚ö†Ô∏èTeams often fail because they overworked themselves on a feature that their product manager would have been willing to compromise on

### Managing a project

1. Break complex end goal into smaller pieces
2. Put those pieces in the most effective order they should be done
3. Identify those pieces in the most effective order they should be done
4. Identify which pieces can be done in parallel or in sequence
5. Attempt to tease out the unknowns of the project. That may cause it to slow down or fail

Your main objectives:
- Addressing uncertainty
- Trying to find the unknowns
- Recognizing that you are going to make mistakes and miss some unknowns

## How to be a great tech lead?

- **Understand the architecture**.
    - Take time to learn it. Get a sense, visualize it.
    - Understand its connections, where the data lives, how it flows between systems. understand how it reflects the product it is supporting, where the code logic for those product lives.

- **Be a team player**.
    - If you are doing all the interesting work yourself, stop.
    - If you‚Äôre only doing the most boring stuff, stop.
    - Working on the less exciting parts of the code base can teach you a lot about where the process is broken.

- **Lead technical decisions**.
    - Determine which decisions must be made by you, which decisions should be delegated to other with more expertise, and which decisions require the whole team to resolve.
        - if alone = they will resent you and blame you when things go wrong
        - if all up to the team = risk of drag on without resolution

- **Communicate**.
    - Your productivity is now less important than the productivity of the whole team.
    - Successful leaders:
        - write well
        - read carefully
        - can get up in front of a group and speak
        - pay attention in meetings
        - are constantly testing the limits of their knowledge (and of their team)
    - Listen!
        - Hear what people say.
        - Practice repeating back to people to ensure you understand them.
        - Learn to hear, and rephrase with your own words.
        - Be a note taker.

## Managing people (p50)

### How to start a new reporting relationship.

- **Build trust and rapport**.
    - How do you like to be praised? (in public or private?)
    - What‚Äôs your preferred method of communication for feedback? (written or verbal?)
    - Why did you decide to work here? What are you excited about?
    - How do I know when you‚Äôre in a bad mood or annoyed?
    - Any manager behaviors that you know you hate?
    - Do you have any clear career goals?
    - Any surprises since you‚Äôve joined? (good or bad)\

    => see Lara Hogan‚Äôs blog: [Questions for our first 1:1](https://larahogan.me/blog/first-one-on-one-questions/)

- **Create a 30/60/90 day plan**.
    - TODO

- **Communicate your style and expectations**.
    - How often you want to meet
    - How you two share information
    - When/how you review the work (ex: weekly summary of progress by email?)
    - How long you work alone trying to solve a problem

- **Get feedback**.
    - First 90 days = fresh eyes
    - TODO

### 1-1: different 1-1 styles

-  **The to-do list meetings**.
    - One or both parties comes with a list of objectives to cover.
    - Follows ‚Äúdon‚Äôt waste time with pointless meetings‚Äù

    üëçVery professional and efficient\
    üëéA bit cold

- **The catch-up**.
    - The meeting is driven by the report. Whatever they feel is important

    üëçCreative discussion and planning meeting\
    üëéCan become a complaining session or therapy


- **The feedback meeting**.
    - Quarterly
    - If thinking of firing = document these feedback meetings (issues discussed and expectations).
    - If need of immediate corrective feedback (ex: insult) don‚Äôt wait for the 1-1 (same for praise).

- **The progress report**.
    - If managing individuals = only for side projects

- **Getting to know you**.
    - Get to know the person as a human being
    - Let them talk about family, friends, hobbies, pets
    - Get to know their career so far
    - Ask about long term career goals

- **Mix it up!**
    - Do walking meetings, or over coffee or lunch
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è If not taking notes = risk of forgetting
    - Do the 1-1 in private
    - Keep notes in a shared document. Keep context about when and what was said. Useful for writing review and delivering feedback.

### Delegating
A good leader is good at delegating.

- **Use team‚Äôs goals to understand which details to dig into.**
    - Ask them to make successes visible to you
    - Only if they have nothing to share, dig into more details
    - If they don‚Äôt have a clear plan, help them create one.
    - What are you holding them accountable against this month, this quarter, this year?

- **Gather information from systems before going to the people**.
    - Commits, tickets, etc.

- **Adjust focus depending on the stage of the projects**.
    - Beginning = more involved (facilitate good set of goals or system design)
    - Close to delivery date = more details (more decisions to be made, with more actionable actions)
    - Normal workflow = enough to know what is moving forward and what is taking longer

- **Establish standards for code and systems**
    - Develop guidelines and standards (ex: how much UT? Code reviews? Etc)

- **Treat open sharing of info (good or bad) in a neutral way**.
    - ex: do not punish mistakes with micromanagement

### Creating a culture of continuous feedback  (p61)
1. **Know your people**.
    - What are their goals?
    - Their strengths/weaknesses?
    - At what level are they operating?
    - What is needed to get to the next level?
2. **Observe your people**.
    - Look for talents and achievements in the teams
    - Look for weaknesses and areas of improvements, too
    - Identify people who deserve praise
    - Every week, try to have at least one thing you can recognize about someone on your team.
    - Ideally, have one weekly think for **everyone** of the team

3. **Provide lightweight, regular feedback**.
    - Start with positive feedback. It makes people more likely to listen to critical feedback.

4. (Bonus) **Provide coaching**.
    - Ask what they might have done differently
    - Make suggestions
    - Form a partnership


### Performance reviews

- **360 model**: includes feedback from:
    - Manager
    - Teammates
    - Anyone who reports to him
    - Coworkers he interacts with
    - Self-review

    The manager gathers all feedback and summarizes.

    ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks:
    -  We tend to remember / overemphasize recent things only
    - Various biases (ex: risk of criticizing people for behaviors that we don‚Äôt notice in others)


- **Give yourself time, and start early**.
    - Plan to spend solid, uninterrupted time working on reviews.
    - Work from home if needed.

- **Try to account for the whole year, not just the past couple of months**.
    - Keep notes of what happened with each person throughout the year.
    - Keep a running summary of 1-1s, including feedback

- **Use concrete examples and excerpts form peer reviews**.
    - Be specific to avoid underlying bias.
    - If possible, anonymize the peer reviews.

- **Spend plenty of time on accomplishments and strengths**.
    - Celebrate achievements
    - Talk about what‚Äôs going well
    - Praise good work
    - Don‚Äôt let people skip over good stuff (it‚Äôs very common)
    - These strengths will be used to determine when people should be promoted. Reflect on them.

- **When it comes to areas of improvements, keep it focused**.
    - Exemples of common themes:
        - Struggle with saying no to distractions
        - Do good work but is overly critical to others, is rude, etc
        - Struggle to break work into intermediate deliverables
        - Do not work well with other departments
        - Struggle to follow the accepted best practices of the team
        - Use your judgement.
            - ex: if only one person mentions ¬´ sloppy work ¬ª: is it true? Or maybe the reviewer had higher standards than the rest of the team?

    - If no feedback for improvement : indicate 1 or 2 skills they need to expand to become qualified for promotion

- **Avoid big surprises**.
    - If underperforming: the review should _not_ be the first time getting that feedback.
    - If recently promoted : prepare them for higher standards and expectations .

- **Schedule enough time to discuss the review**.
    - Give people a printed copy of the review the evening before
    - Still take time to go over each section (do not skip strengths and accomplishments)

## How to identify potential?
- Real potential shows itself quickly:
    - Work hard to go the extra mile
    - Offer insightful suggestions on problems
    - Help the team in areas previously neglected
- Potential must be tied to **actions** and **value produced**, even if it‚Äôs not the value you expected to see produced.

### Cultivating careers
The manager plays a key role in getting people promoted.

- Your job is to:
    - Make sure they are learning how to estimate their own work
    - Get it done roughly within the estimates
    - Learn from their mistakes

- Evidence for promotion :
    - Projects or features completed independently
    - Participation in on-call rotations
    - Engagement in team meetings / team planning

- Learn how the game is played at your company. Ask your manager:
    - How are the decisions made?
    - How early do you need to start preparing packets?
    - Are there limits on the number of promotions per year?

- Be transparent with the team.
    - Identify promotion-worthy projects.
    - Give them to people close to promotion.
    - Encourage people to volunteer.

### Firing underperformers
- Wite a person a **performance improvement plan**.
    - Set of clearly defined objectives that the person post achieve within a fixed period of time.
- The process should begin long before!
    - Rule of no surprises.
    - Start giving feedback early and often, and keep records.

‚ö†Ô∏èIf you avoid tackling negative feedback until it builds to a building point m, you‚Äôre going to be met with a pile of excuses.

## Managing a team (p75)
- The Engineering lead is an **independant manager**.
    - Manage team members with different skill sets from their own
    - Communicate expectations clearly
    - Solicit and deliver individual feedback frequently
    - Leader for the technical roadmap:
        - communicate the timeline, scope and risks
    - Identify areas of strategic technical debt:
        - do cost/benefit analysis for resolving the debt
        - communicate suggested timelines for this.

- **Staying technical**.
    - Engineering management is a **technical discipline**, not just a set of people skills.
    - Your job will require that you guide technical decision making. **Technical instincts** honed over years of doing the job are very important for guiding this process.
    - If you truly wish to command the respect of an engineering team, they must see you as **technically credible**.
