# The Art of Decision-Making
How we Move from Indecision to Smart Choices.\

# Part I. Indecision

## Chapter 1. Paradise lost

Indecisiveness can result when we have **two desires in conflict** with each other (head/heart, work/play, long-term/short-term, affordability/quality, etc)

Careful weighing of true priorities, applying intuition as well as logic, is the optimum way forward.

By not deciding, I gain access to the magical world of **virtual reality**, where two contradictory options can happily co-exist. I can live in the **comforting illusion that choice will remain a possibility**.

We often irrationally refuse to commit to a choice, even though we know this is counterproductive.

To develop we need to change, and change means **giving up something we had formerly enjoyed**.

**There is no proper decision without consciousness**, and **there is no consciousness without transformation**. This transformation comes from abandoning any intentions of returning to the "lost paradise".

One of the things that may hold us back is an **attachment to known comforts**, or a **fear of the unknown**. Growing into greater maturity and consciousness is painful but rewarding. It is the source of our best decision making.


## Chapter 2. Defence forces

Those who find themselves unable to “make the cut” are likely to have built a variety of effective defense mechanisms to avoid making decisions.

### Mini-living

Mini-living is the idea that choice is overrated. Exemple of Mark Zuckerberg single outfit every day.
It’s creating the illusion that we are more focused and efficient.
We risk becoming **creatures of habit** and may **end up getting stuck**.

Why decide on something new when the status who seems much more efficient? It’s important to **question whether the tried-and-tested methods are adequate**. Are they holding us back?

### Outsourcing
An important refuge to avoiding decisions is the **reliance on fate**. Ex: rolling a dice.

By outsourcing our decisions to fate, **we do not expand the person we are**. Instead, **we split ourselves into different personas**. It take us in the opposite direction to the path we should pursue: the path toward individuation and self-fulfillment.

Another variation is **delegating the decision to someone else**.
_“Why don’t you decide? It’s all the same to me.”_
It may not be a matter of consciously deferring to their greater wisdom. It may be a **form of surrender**.
It can lead to a bout of ping pong until a decision is made by default.

### Procrastination
The next defence strategy is the endless postponement of decisions.
The underlying idea is that a more informed decision is likely to be a better one.
But it’s sometimes a pretext for avoiding decisions, hoping that’s if we wait long enough, the choice will be made for us.

It relies on the false premise that we can control the timing of our decisions.
**It creates the illusion that we have mastery over our decision making**. In reality, postponing a decision is often akin to negating it.

### Perfectionism
If we seek to make decisions only when we are in control of the outcome, we end up never deciding on anything.
We will often blame a lack of knowledge: _“I can’t decide until I have all the information in hand”._

We should be **grateful for the information we have**, rather than fearful about the knowledge we lack.
The greatest myth around procrastination is the idea that if I postpone today’s decision until tomorrow, I will be better informed then than I am now.

What is this critical information that will make all the difference?
The lack of relevant information is often used as a handy excuse for delaying decision making. If you believe you need more information, **switch to research mode, without delay**. But don’t over-research - another way we can fool ourselves to remain undecided.

The impossible quest for perfection gives us the perfect alibi to keep living in the virtual world, where perfection is always a possibility.
**Let’s celebrate imperfection**.
**Perfectionism can only lead us to failure**, because there is no such thing as perfection. It can be seen as self-abuse.

### Osmosis
Osmosis is when "not deciding" becomes who we are.
It protects us because, as it infiltrates our character, we are unlikely to be solicited for decisions by others.
But then **we lose faith in our opinions through a vicious circle of self-doubt**.

## Chapter 3. Project fear

> Worrying is like paying a debt you don’t owe.\
> -Mark Twain

**Fear is not always a negative emotion**. It can make us more alert to unforeseen risks, and it can help us to protect others as well as ourselves against potential dangers.

This paradox is possible because we are animated by two different goals: a **prevention focus** (we want to protect ourselves) and a **promotion focus** (we want to make progress).

Fear is not only a decision-inhibitor but can also be a decision-shaper, something that influences us beyond reason.

Prospect theory indicates that people are **loss-averse**:
- Most people would prefer winning $100 with certainty to a 50% chance of winning either $200 or nothing.
- And yet most people prefer a 50% chance of losing either $200 or nothing to a certain $100 loss.

The same person who is risk-seeking when faced with possible loss will be reluctant to take risks when faced with possible gain.

**The fear of a loss drives us toward riskier behaviors** in a way that cannot be explained by reason alone.

Decision-fear falls into seven categories:

### Fears about the choices we make

1. **Fear of rejecting a better option**

Also known as **Fear Of Missing Out**.
It makes us feel paralyzed when it comes to committing to a decision.
It is conjointes with the fear of having regrets.

**Regrets never serves us well**, even when we make questionable decisions. **Even worse is fear of regret**, since that paralyses is into inaction.

Our decisions are like butterflies:
- Some are dazzling and colorful, some are quite dull.
- What they have in common is that they pass through different development stages, from the caterpillar to the pupa from which they will emerge.
- The butterfly never goes back to the comfort of the chrysalis.
- The chrysalis of decision making is irrelevant once a decision is made.
- **We cannot change a decision: we can only take a new one** that may or may not alter its outcome.

Our deciding mind differentiates regrets between two experiences :
- **Errors or commission** = regrets for the things we did and wish we hadn’t
- **Errors of omission** = regrets for the things we did not do and we wish we had

**In the short term, regrets for commission (things we did) affect us more than regrets for omission. However, over time, the opposite happen.**

2. **Fear of choosing the wrong option**

Making decisions under risk causes **loss aversion bias**:
- **Non-linear probability weighting**. We tend to overweight small probabilities and underweight large probabilities.
- **Reference dependence**. We tend to evaluate outcomes relative to our own arbitrary reference point and classify them as gains if better than the reference point, and as losses if worse.
- **Gain and loss satiation**. A $2m lottery gain would not make you twice as happy as a $1m gain. Losing $10 produces more pain than winning $10 produces pleasure.
- **The Dunning-Kriger effect**. Tendency for unskilled individuals to overestimate their own ability, and for experts to underestimate their own ability.
- **The curse of knowledge**. Some better-informed people find it extremely difficult to thing about problems fro the perspective of lesser-informed people.
- **The cheerleader bias** makes people think that individuals are more attractive when seen in a group.
- **The Von Restorff effect**. An item that sticks out is more likely to be remembered than other items.
- **The Zeigarnik effect**. Uncompleted or interrupted tasks are remembered better than completed ones.
- And many more

**We are never impartial** when we make a decision.
All kind of biases affect our judgement, altering our view of the relevant factors, and influencing the weight we attach to them.
**A degree of self-knowledge will help to ensure that our biases are less likely to become pitfalls**.

Every decision if about resolving a deep contradiction. **Decisions are expensive because they demand renunciation**.

**It is naïve to expect decisions to bring closure**.
Decisions are about creating the least imperfect and most viable balance between conflicting views. They are about achieving balance with the greatest freedom from pre-conserved or pre-programmed notions on our minds.

### Fears about the consequences of our choices

3. **Fear of failure**
