# The Art of Decision-Making
How we Move from Indecision to Smart Choices.\
**Joseph Bikart**, 2019.

# Part I. Indecision

## Chapter 1. Paradise lost

Indecisiveness can result when we have **two desires in conflict** with each other (head/heart, work/play, long-term/short-term, affordability/quality, etc)

Careful weighing of true priorities, applying intuition as well as logic, is the optimum way forward.

By not deciding, I gain access to the magical world of **virtual reality**, where two contradictory options can happily co-exist. I can live in the **comforting illusion that choice will remain a possibility**.

We often irrationally refuse to commit to a choice, even though we know this is counterproductive.

To develop we need to change, and change means **giving up something we had formerly enjoyed**.

**There is no proper decision without consciousness**, and **there is no consciousness without transformation**. This transformation comes from abandoning any intentions of returning to the "lost paradise".

One of the things that may hold us back is an **attachment to known comforts**, or a **fear of the unknown**. Growing into greater maturity and consciousness is painful but rewarding. It is the source of our best decision making.


## Chapter 2. Defence forces

Those who find themselves unable to “make the cut” are likely to have built a variety of effective defense mechanisms to avoid making decisions.

### Mini-living

Mini-living is the idea that choice is overrated. Exemple of Mark Zuckerberg single outfit every day.
It’s creating the illusion that we are more focused and efficient.
We risk becoming **creatures of habit** and may **end up getting stuck**.

Why decide on something new when the status who seems much more efficient? It’s important to **question whether the tried-and-tested methods are adequate**. Are they holding us back?

### Outsourcing
An important refuge to avoiding decisions is the **reliance on fate**. Ex: rolling a dice.

By outsourcing our decisions to fate, **we do not expand the person we are**. Instead, **we split ourselves into different personas**. It take us in the opposite direction to the path we should pursue: the path toward individuation and self-fulfillment.

Another variation is **delegating the decision to someone else**.
_“Why don’t you decide? It’s all the same to me.”_
It may not be a matter of consciously deferring to their greater wisdom. It may be a **form of surrender**.
It can lead to a bout of ping pong until a decision is made by default.

### Procrastination
The next defence strategy is the endless postponement of decisions.
The underlying idea is that a more informed decision is likely to be a better one.
But it’s sometimes a pretext for avoiding decisions, hoping that’s if we wait long enough, the choice will be made for us.

It relies on the false premise that we can control the timing of our decisions.
**It creates the illusion that we have mastery over our decision making**. In reality, postponing a decision is often akin to negating it.

### Perfectionism
If we seek to make decisions only when we are in control of the outcome, we end up never deciding on anything.
We will often blame a lack of knowledge: _“I can’t decide until I have all the information in hand”._

We should be **grateful for the information we have**, rather than fearful about the knowledge we lack.
The greatest myth around procrastination is the idea that if I postpone today’s decision until tomorrow, I will be better informed then than I am now.

What is this critical information that will make all the difference?
The lack of relevant information is often used as a handy excuse for delaying decision making. If you believe you need more information, **switch to research mode, without delay**. But don’t over-research - another way we can fool ourselves to remain undecided.

The impossible quest for perfection gives us the perfect alibi to keep living in the virtual world, where perfection is always a possibility.
**Let’s celebrate imperfection**.
**Perfectionism can only lead us to failure**, because there is no such thing as perfection. It can be seen as self-abuse.

### Osmosis
Osmosis is when "not deciding" becomes who we are.
It protects us because, as it infiltrates our character, we are unlikely to be solicited for decisions by others.
But then **we lose faith in our opinions through a vicious circle of self-doubt**.

## Chapter 3. Project fear

> Worrying is like paying a debt you don’t owe.\
> -Mark Twain

**Fear is not always a negative emotion**. It can make us more alert to unforeseen risks, and it can help us to protect others as well as ourselves against potential dangers.

This paradox is possible because we are animated by two different goals: a **prevention focus** (we want to protect ourselves) and a **promotion focus** (we want to make progress).

Fear is not only a decision-inhibitor but can also be a decision-shaper, something that influences us beyond reason.

Prospect theory indicates that people are **loss-averse**:
- Most people would prefer winning $100 with certainty to a 50% chance of winning either $200 or nothing.
- And yet most people prefer a 50% chance of losing either $200 or nothing to a certain $100 loss.

The same person who is risk-seeking when faced with possible loss will be reluctant to take risks when faced with possible gain.

**The fear of a loss drives us toward riskier behaviors** in a way that cannot be explained by reason alone.

Decision-fear falls into seven categories:

### Fears about the choices we make

1. **Fear of rejecting a better option**

Also known as **Fear Of Missing Out**.
It makes us feel paralyzed when it comes to committing to a decision.
It is conjointes with the fear of having regrets.

**Regrets never serves us well**, even when we make questionable decisions. **Even worse is fear of regret**, since that paralyses is into inaction.

Our decisions are like butterflies:
- Some are dazzling and colorful, some are quite dull.
- What they have in common is that they pass through different development stages, from the caterpillar to the pupa from which they will emerge.
- The butterfly never goes back to the comfort of the chrysalis.
- The chrysalis of decision making is irrelevant once a decision is made.
- **We cannot change a decision: we can only take a new one** that may or may not alter its outcome.

Our deciding mind differentiates regrets between two experiences :
- **Errors or commission** = regrets for the things we did and wish we hadn’t
- **Errors of omission** = regrets for the things we did not do and we wish we had

**In the short term, regrets for commission (things we did) affect us more than regrets for omission. However, over time, the opposite happen.**

2. **Fear of choosing the wrong option**

Making decisions under risk causes **loss aversion bias**:
- **Non-linear probability weighting**. We tend to overweight small probabilities and underweight large probabilities.
- **Reference dependence**. We tend to evaluate outcomes relative to our own arbitrary reference point and classify them as gains if better than the reference point, and as losses if worse.
- **Gain and loss satiation**. A $2m lottery gain would not make you twice as happy as a $1m gain. Losing $10 produces more pain than winning $10 produces pleasure.
- **The Dunning-Kriger effect**. Tendency for unskilled individuals to overestimate their own ability, and for experts to underestimate their own ability.
- **The curse of knowledge**. Some better-informed people find it extremely difficult to thing about problems fro the perspective of lesser-informed people.
- **The cheerleader bias** makes people think that individuals are more attractive when seen in a group.
- **The Von Restorff effect**. An item that sticks out is more likely to be remembered than other items.
- **The Zeigarnik effect**. Uncompleted or interrupted tasks are remembered better than completed ones.
- And many more

**We are never impartial** when we make a decision.
All kind of biases affect our judgement, altering our view of the relevant factors, and influencing the weight we attach to them.
**A degree of self-knowledge will help to ensure that our biases are less likely to become pitfalls**.

Every decision if about resolving a deep contradiction. **Decisions are expensive because they demand renunciation**.

**It is naïve to expect decisions to bring closure**.
Decisions are about creating the least imperfect and most viable balance between conflicting views. They are about achieving balance with the greatest freedom from pre-conserved or pre-programmed notions on our minds.

### Fears about the consequences of our choices

1. **Fear of failure**

Failure is, at least partially, outside of our control.

We can try to mitigate risk through our actions on the things we control. However, **we will only bring frustration if we try to gain control over anything that sits outside our sphere of influence**.

Fear of failure isn’t fear of risk but rather **fear of the consequences of risk**, and the uncertainty surrounding those consequences.

The binary vision of the world (_"it will necessary be a choice between right and wrong"_) is a false construct. The more we try to distinguish right from wrong, the less we are able to discern between them.

The best decision-makers are those who respond lightly to chaos, wherever possible, rather than imagining they can still its turbulence by a large measure of reason. **Be creative and accepting, rather than fearful and resistant**, and you are likelier to prevail.

Fear of failure may be linked to the fear of the consequences on others (partner, parents, colleague, etc).
**We are often wrong about how they are thinking**.
Not only are we overly focus on other people's judgement, but **our perception of their expectations is also distorted by bias**.

2. **Fear of heights**

This is the fear that sets in when we ask ourselves: _what if it works?_

These positive prospects might fill us with joy, but they may also **create their own flavor of anxiety**. Because success will create its own demands.

The fear of heights is not the fear of vertigo but a **fear of achievement** (_where do I go next?_).

Sometimes we may hold back from a decision because we know in advance that we lack the resources to deal with the impact of success.

3. **Fear of identification**

It’s the belief that any criticism of what we have created is a criticism of the intrinsic self. Our inner voice tells us: _you are what you do_.

Identification with our work and our actions is a common source of fear.

We worry that our name will forever be associated with the enterprise, which will define us, and necessarily limit us.

This limitation reduces our scope by **creating artificial boundaries for us**. Hence, the fear of identification is also a **fear of narrowness**.

The best decision-making emerges when we **allow ourselves to be authentic**. Worrying about how a decision will make us appear to others is likely to result in poor choices, and will rob us of any prospect of true fulfillment.

4. **Fear of lack of recognition**

This fear is that a project that is not truly ours will use our time and energy and distract us from our own personal agenda. This is also the fear of being taken for granted, of being disrespected.

A fully rounded person will always allow empathy to enter the field of play.

TODO

5. **Fear of selfishness**

It’s the fear of upsetting others, or of being perceived as acting in a selfish manner.

Our path cannot be constantly obstructed by this concern. Only by being grounded in our own personality can we truly be of service to others.

**We are not responsible for people’s emotional states**, only for our own acts and intentions, and for ensuring that we do not willfully or negligently cause harm.

The solution is to **not overrule our decisions**. Tend to your psyches and start exploring the joy that comes from giving without expectations.

## Chapter 4. Through the looking glass

When during childhood your psyche has been affected by the experience and internalization of engulfment/insufficient anxiety, it is likely that **later in like you will seek to overcompensate for what has been lacking**.

When it come to decision-making, if we are stuck in a similar patterns we may suddenly find that every decision seems labeled with the words "mission impossible".

There are eleven places where we may get stuck.

- **Abandonment**. Fear of being abandoned by your partner or someone else important to you.
- **Mistrust/abuse**. You mistrust others or tend to find yourself in abusives situations.
- **Emotional deprivation**. You feel you will never obtain the love you need.
- **Dependence**. You feel unable to keep going without having someone to look after you.
- **Defectiveness**. You feel there is something seriously wrong with you, though you might not know quite what it is.
- **Social exclusion**. You feel like an outsider, unable to fit in well with everyone else.
- **Failure**. You feel yourself as a failure, based on your poor track record for success.
- **Entitlement**. You feel that the world owes you something.
- **Subjugation**. You feel controlled by other people.
- **Vulnerability**. You feel something terrible is likely to happen to you personally.
- **Unrelenting standards**. You feel you must push yourself constantly, allowing not one for rest or enjoyment.

Identifying where we are stuck is essential.

These wounds are commonplace and can affect all of us. Our decision making can be improved if we are honest enough to probe our own insecurities.

### Key skill: How to manage risk

When a risk is identified, you are faced with four clear options: **accept**, **reduce**, **transfer** or **avoid**.

- **Acceptance** if best undertaken after you have **reduced** the risk as much as possible without diminishing the reward too much.
- **Transferring** means involving others in your enterprise. For example, finding a financial backer.
- **Avoidance** means either:
    - accepting the current situation instead of deciding on a risky new adventure
    - or else looking for a safer method of changing what is unsatisfactory about the status quo.

An effective person will move toward their vision **knowing there will be failures on the way**, often requiring an improvised change of strategy. **Failure teaches better than success**.

#### All-around thinking
Risk management should be a key part of every project.
Seeking views from people with relevant experience is an essential part of the assessment process.

It is important to clarify **who owns the risk**:
- if it’s apparent from the beginning, the risks are likely to be better monitored and controlled.
- if there is no clarity, failure will likely result in a miasma of confusion and blame.

Finally you need to **plan what happens if things go right** as well as if things go wrong.
Any undertaking has built-in opportunities as well as risks, and both should be scrutinized equally.


# Part II. Where are thou?

## Chapter 5. Self starters

If the Self is implicated in decisions, it has to be:
- responsible, as an active agent.
- answerable and accountable for the consequences of a decision.

Behind any lack of decisiveness, there is a lack of implication.

## Chapter 6. Hidden chambers

The COSARC pyramid:
Creativity
Options
Selection

### 1. Creativity

Creativity in decision making depends heavily on **intuition**.

Our exploration must begin with **our own feelings, sensations and intuition** about what’s is needed.

This can often be nourished if you try to **think like a child again**. As adults we form attachments to what we believe are sophisticated ways of thinking, but often these approaches are over-complex and sidestep our most direct and deeply felt responses. Recapturing a child’s direct vision can be deeply liberating.

### 2. Options

One of the key principles of negotiation is that **the more options we create** (within reason), **the more likely we are to arrive at a mutually satisfactory outcome**.

We never really run out of options. Any situation is a junction from which many possibilities lead, even if some of them are hidden.

Studying other people’s experiences gives us a multi-sidedness that can enrich our decision making. However, **we should also aim to generate this multi-sidedness within ourselves, and by ourselves**.

One way of achieving this is by **reframing our decisions**.

Reframing and rephrasing can have a critical impact on our decisions without altering the options.
Exemple when facing surgery with 2 possible framings: _“survival rate of 90%”_ vs _“mortality rate of 10%”_. The first framing **increases acceptance, even though the situation remains identical**.
